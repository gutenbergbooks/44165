<div class='adtitle2'>SOLDIER RIGDALE</div>




<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>PLAYING WITH POWDER</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>WITH the approach of sunset, the wind
that all day had ruffled the waves to
white edges died down, till there was
left on the water only a long, heaving motion,
that rudely swayed the old ship <i>Mayflower</i>. One
moment from her broad deck could be seen the
steel-like gleam of the fresh-water pond on the
distant beach; the next moment, as the ship rolled
between the waves, the shore presented nothing but
solid sand dunes and shrubby pine trees. But
always overhead the sky, athwart which the yards,
bulging with the furled sails, were raking, remained
the same,&mdash;a level reach of thick gray that, as twilight
drew on, seemed to brood closer over earth
and ocean.</div>

<p>How those yards seesawed up and down with
the rolling of the ship, and the mastheads, they
dipped too, quite as if they might pitch down
upon a body! Miles Rigdale, standing with legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
craftily planted and head thrown well back, stared
and stared at their measured movement till, dizzy
with the feeling that the great spars were tottering
loose, he was glad to straighten his aching neck
once more.</p>

<p>"Did you see a goose, all roasted, flying for your
mouth?" Francis Billington called from the waist
of the ship, where he perched jauntily upon the
bulwark.</p>

<p>Sauntering from his place near the companion
way, Miles halted beside the speaker; not that he
had a great liking for Francis Billington, but he
was a sociable lad, who must talk to some one, and,
as the bleak air had driven the women and children
into the great cabin, while the men were absent,&mdash;the
leaders conferring in the roundhouse and the
lesser men seeking firewood on shore,&mdash;he could
for the moment find no comrade save young Billington.</p>

<p>The latter was an unprepossessing lad, stunted
and small for his fourteen years, with elfish eyes
which he now turned sharply on Miles. "I take
it, Jack Cooke is ill, and Giles Hopkins has packed
you about your business, that you've come to spend
the time with me," he suggested disagreeably.</p>

<p>"I take it, maybe you've spoke the truth," Miles
answered unruffled, as he propped his chin on his
fists and braced his elbows against the bulwark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Gazing thus northward, he could see all about
him green hills, wooded to the water's edge, now
higher, now lower, as the ship mounted upon the
waves, and the strip of sand beach, off which rode
the bobbing longboat. "I wish my father had
taken me with him when they went to fetch the
wood," Miles broke out at that sight; "it's weeks
and weeks since I set foot on land."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I've been ashore thrice already," bragged
Francis, setting one arm akimbo, though he took
good care to grip the shrouds tightly with the other
hand, for the bulwark was not the safest of perches.</p>

<p>Miles tried to swallow down his envy, but he
could not help saying, with a touch of triumph:
"Anyhow, you saw no savages, and my father saw
'em when he went exploring with Captain Standish,&mdash;six
Indians and a dog, he saw."</p>

<p>"So did my father," Francis sought to crush
him; but Miles, declaring sudden truce, was asking,
with civil interest: "You did not see any lions
when you went ashore, did you, Francis?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, but Ned Dotey thought he heard one
roar the other night."</p>

<p>"Father would not take our mastiff Trug on land
lest they kill him. Trug would give 'em a fight for
it, though. But he couldn't fight the serpents; nobody
could. Did you know, Francie, there's a
serpent here in America,&mdash;they call it the rattlesnake,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
if it but breathe on you, you die
presently."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Francis, awed, but
incredulous.</p>

<p>"My father read it in a book about plantations
in Virginia. Maybe the serpents lie close in cold
weather, though, so you did not see them." Miles
was silent a long instant, while he gazed fixedly at
the mysterious shore yonder, where all these rarities
were to be met with. "The trees do not look like
our English trees," he said, half to himself, "but
I'd fain go in among them. Perhaps you found
conies there, Francis? There were a plenty of them
on the common at home; Trug and I used to chase
them, and 'twas brave sport."</p>

<p>"Mayhap if you had Trug with you, you could
start some here," suggested Francis. "Tell you,
Miles, you beg your father let you go ashore to-morrow,
and I'll go too, and we'll seek for conies
together. Will you?"</p>

<p>"'Tis no use," Miles answered, scowling straight
ahead.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Father says I cannot go," the boy blurted out.
"I answered him saucily this morning, and he said
for that I should not stir foot off the ship for a
week. I think&mdash;I think he might let me go
ashore. Along the first I was coughing, so my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
mother said I must not venture in the boat; and
then my sister Dolly was ailing, and I must stay to
bear her company; and then it stormed; and now
he will not let me go. And I am so weary of this
ship!"</p>

<p>"I'd not bear such usage from any man," Francis
boasted grandly. "If 'twere my daddy treated me
so harshly, I'd tell him to his face 'a' was a sour old
curmudgeon, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You need not talk so of my father," Miles
interrupted sullenly, though he held his eyes fixed
upon the shore line, not on the speaker. It was
hard, while he looked toward the land of wonders,
still unknown to him, to think quite kindly of the
father who had arbitrarily shut him out from the
enjoyment of it. "If you miscall him so again,
Francis, I'll fight you," he added, conscience-stricken,
in the hope of making amends for the
disloyalty of his thoughts.</p>

<p>Francis bent his sharp eyes on his companion,
but did not take up the challenge; indeed, a less
discreet lad than he might have considered an instant
before coming to fisticuffs with Miles Rigdale.
The boy, for his scant eleven years, was of a proper
height, with straight back and sturdy limbs, a stocky,
yet not clumsy, little figure, that promised a vigorous
stature when he came to man's age. His
deeply tanned face, that was lightly sprinkled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
brown freckles, was square and resolute; his blue
eyes were very level and honest; and his tousled
brown hair tumbled about his forehead in a way to
make more women than his mother think him a
bonny boy. For the rest, he was clad humbly
enough in doublet and breeches of dark gray frieze,
with long gray stockings and stout shoes; he wore
neither cloak nor hat, and his clenched fists, that
now rested firmly on the bulwark, were bare and
chapped red by the wind.</p>

<p>It was the sight of the aggressive fists that made
Francis use a different tone: "You're a pretty
comrade, Miles, to fly out at me so."</p>

<p>"You may leave my father in peace, then."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd wish me to leave you in peace
too. I know Goodman Rigdale has forbid his little
son speak to me."</p>

<p>"I'm still speaking to you, am I not?" answered
Miles, and bent to adjust one of his shoes, so
Francis could not see his face; those last words
had hit dangerously near.</p>

<p>"But you'll show me a clean pair of heels very
speedily," sneered his companion, "for yonder the
boat with your good father is putting off from shore,
and when he comes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's how the wind blows, is it?" struck in
a new voice close at hand. Looking over his
shoulder, Miles saw, lounging on a coil of rope by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the foremast, a certain Edward Lister, one of the
servants of Master Stephen Hopkins. He was a
slim, dark fellow of some twenty years, whom Miles
admired for a tall swaggerer, because he always wore
his red cap rakishly on one side, and, since the rules
about lighting tobacco aboard ship were strict, was
ever chewing at a long pine splinter instead of a
pipe. "So if your father catch you with Master
Billington here, he'll swinge you soundly, eh, Miles
Rigdale?" he asked, with his mouth quite grave,
but a glancing mockery in his black eyes. "Better
show us how briskly you can run into the
cabin."</p>

<p>Miles ostentatiously leaned his shoulders against
the bulwark and crossed one leg over the other, as
if he thought to finish the afternoon in that position.
Shifting round thus, his gaze travelled beyond his
companions to the high quarter-deck, where he
spied several men trudging forth from the roundhouse.
"Has the conference broken off?" he
asked, forgetting in his curiosity that he was angry
with both Francis and Ned Lister.</p>

<p>"How else?" the latter answered dryly, and,
rising to his feet, sauntered over to the two boys.
"D'ye think they would confer without the great
Master Hopkins? And he quit the roundhouse
long since. Wearied out, doubtless, with such vigorous
labor. It has taken them an hour to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
no more than to send forth a gang to-morrow
and try a third time for a place where we may
settle."</p>

<p>"Another exploration? Is my father to go on
it, do you know?" Miles questioned.</p>

<p>"They won't let any but the great folk have a
hand therein; daddy said 'twould be so," commented
Francis.</p>

<p>"True enough," scoffed Lister; "the Governor,
and Captain Standish, Master Bradford, Master
Winslow, Master Hopkins, and&mdash;the worshipful
Master Edward Dotey."</p>

<p>"Aha!" jeered Francis. "They're taking old
Hopkins's other man Dotey along, and Ned Lister
is jealous of him."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" cried Lister, catching the
lad by the scruff of the neck, "else I'll heave you
over the bulwark."</p>

<p>Francis twisted up his face and opened his mouth
in a prodigious, dry-eyed howl, which would have
set Miles laughing, had he not been intent just
then upon the approaching boat. He could see her
visibly growing larger, as she bounded nearer and
nearer over the swell of the water, and each moment
he recalled more distinctly in what terms his father
had forbidden him have to do with "that Satanish
brood of the Billingtons." Miles shuffled one
foot uneasily; perhaps he really ought to go into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the cabin now and see how his sick friend, Jack
Cooke, was faring.</p>

<p>He turned away and had idled a few paces along
the deck, when Francis, who had been suffered wrest
out of Lister's hold, called after him: "Ah, Miles
daren't let his father find him with me. I knew so."</p>

<p>"It's not so, neither," Miles flung back, and
made a great show of stopping by the mainmast,
where he stood gazing down the open hatchway
which led to those cabins that were in the depth of
the hold. "Aren't you coming with me, Francis?"
he asked presently.</p>

<p>The other, quite undeceived, came snickering up
to him: "Have no fear; I'll take myself off ere
your father come. Sure, you're a stout-hearted one,
Miles."</p>

<p>"You're a pretty fellow to talk of courage," Miles
was goaded into replying, "after the way you
howled out but now. You might have known Ned
Lister'd do you no hurt."</p>

<p>"No doubt you'd not have been afraid," his tormentor
scoffed. "You're not afraid of anybody
save your father."</p>

<p>"So are you, if you told the truth of it," Miles
took him up. "You'd not have Goodman Billington
hear you vaporing so for all the silver crowns
in England, and if Goodwife Billington came by
and heard you, she'd cuff your ears smartly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis's sallow face reddened. "Much she
would!" he said angrily. "I'll show you I be no
milksop to stand in fear of my father and mother.
Maybe now you think I'd not dare to&mdash;" he
paused, his eyes half-closed, while he tried to concoct
some peculiarly wicked sounding project&mdash;"to
take some of my father's gunpowder and make
squibs?" he concluded, with a triumphant look at
his companion.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think you dare," Miles answered
stolidly.</p>

<p>"Come, then, I'll show you," the other cried,
and headed for the companion way that descended
beneath the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>Four steps down, and, passing through a narrow
door, they entered into the stifle and stir of
the "great" or main cabin. On every hand murmured
the ceaseless confusion that always filled the
straitened space: underfoot, sometimes with fretful
wrangling, children were at play; women were passing
to and from their cabins, or dressing their meat
for the evening meal at the long table; upon the
benches several sick men, whose heavy voices were
audible through the shriller tones of those about
them, sat together in talk. Over all, the brightness
from the narrow skylights fell wanly, so the corners
of the low apartment were dusky with thick shadows,
and the dim outline of the great timbers overhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and the slits of doors into the double tier of little
cabins adjoining, could only just be made out.</p>

<p>Miles was glad of the half light, for he knew well
that if his mother should chance to be there and see
him with Francis, she would make a pretext of some
task to call him to her. He caught sight of her
now, as she stood by the table in speech with Constance
Hopkins, and, almost treading on Francis's
heels in his hurry, he slipped into the Billingtons'
cabin.</p>

<p>It was the veriest closet of a room in which he
found himself, black, save for a glint of sickly light
that crept through an opening in the door, by which
Miles contrived presently to discern the unmade
bunk along the wall, the mattress, still spread out
upon the floor, and the iron kettle and other vague
household stuff that littered untidily the narrow
space. Comparing it with his father's ordered
cabin, he recalled his mother's indignant comment
to Mistress Hopkins, that Ellen Billington was a
poor, thriftless body, who would better be tidying
her quarters than gossiping with her neighbors.</p>

<p>"Now you'll see what I dare, Master Miles,"
Francis broke in, as, with much panting, he dragged
from beneath the bunk a small keg. "This is gunpowder,
if you be not afraid of the sight of it."</p>

<p>"It does not take much courage to touch gunpowder,"
said Miles, bending forward from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
bunk, where he had seated himself, and plunging
his fist into the keg. "Let's see your squibs,
Francis."</p>

<p>Young Billington stretched himself on his stomach
and, grubbing once more beneath the bunk, drew
out a fistful of rustling papers. "These are leaves
I tore from a jest book of daddy's," he bragged.
"No doubt you won't believe I durst."</p>

<p>Miles made no reply; after all, he scarcely cared
to prolong his differences with a boy who had such
a delightful plaything as a keg of powder. "Let
me make a squib too, Francie," he begged, squatting
down on the mattress beside his host.</p>

<p>For a space there was silence, while, with some
hard breathing, the two, guided more by touch than
by any sight they had in the dark cabin, labored industriously.
Blacker and blacker it grew all round
them, till they struck their hands together as they
groped in the keg, when a ray of faint yellow light,
that must fall from a lantern in the great cabin, stole
through the door.</p>

<p>Now they could see how they were faring at their
work, and Francis, who had laid his handfuls of
powder on the papers and folded them quite dexterously,
laughed in provoking fashion at Miles, who,
new to this game, had spilt the powder and failed to
make his papers stay folded. "It's all very well,"
the boy retorted irritably, as one of his painfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
made squibs, bursting open, scattered powder between
his knees, "but after you've made these
mighty squibs what else do you do?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'll light a bit of match," said Francis,
scrambling to his feet, "and then we'll touch 'em off."</p>

<p>Miles jumped up delightedly, and, reasoning that
a really satisfactory squib should be set off in darkness,
took from the bunk a blanket which he fastened
by two nails across the opening in the door.</p>

<p>Meantime Francis had struck his father's flint
and steel together, till at length he succeeded in
catching a spark upon the piece of "match" or
twisted tow steeped in saltpetre. Miles could see
the little red point shimmering in the dark and,
picking up the squibs, he moved warily toward it.
"Gi' me a squib," came Francis's voice, close at his
feet. More accustomed to the dimness now, Miles
could make out the boy's crouching figure and saw
him lean far forward with one arm outstretched to
touch off the powder.</p>

<p>Then he felt Francis crowd up against his knees,
and instinctively he drew back so his own body was
pressed against the wall. Out of the dark on the
floor, right at his feet, started a little flicker of
flame which, with a sudden whishing sound, leaped
up, a broad, bluish puff of fire, almost in his eyes;
then, before the exclamation had left his lips, died
sizzling away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was brave, wasn't it?" spoke Francis, in
a rather quavering voice. "You can touch off one
now."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="322" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">"With his arm up to shut out the glare of the lanterns."</div>
</div>

<p>Miles eagerly seized the match and, setting it to
a squib, flung the twisted paper a pace from him.
The same whiz, burst, sizzle, but this time he lost
the keen pleasure in a sudden hideous thought that,
even as the squib left his hand, came over him.
"Francis," he cried, before the flame died down,
"is this safe, think you? Say the powder in the
keg took fire?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! You're afraid; I knew you'd be," replied
Francis, his own courage quite restored.</p>

<p>Thereupon Miles lit a third squib to show his
fearlessness, and then together they set off the remaining
two. "That's the last, and I've no more
paper," sighed Francis, and Miles echoed the sigh.</p>

<p>They were sitting now on the edge of the bunk;
the cabin seemed very black to their eyes, still dazzled
with the last flash, and the air was hot and heavy
with the pungent odor of burnt powder. Miles
sniffed it contentedly. "This is what 'twould be
like in a great battle," he began. "Sometime I mean
to be a soldier and have a musket. Did you ever
shoot with a musket, Francis?"</p>

<p>"No, but I've shot off a fowling piece," answered
the other. He clambered upon the bunk, groping
audibly in the dark, and presently dropped down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
again beside his companion with something long and
slender and heavy in his arms. "Look you, Miles,
here's daddy's fowling piece now," he said exultantly.
"What say if I shoot her off?"</p>

<p>"'Twould make a mighty big noise in so small a
room," Miles answered longingly.</p>

<p>"Give me the match, then."</p>

<p>Later Miles remembered clearly how Francis had
sprung to his feet at the word, but after that all
was a confusion of dire noises,&mdash;a rending crash,
then a sound of women screaming, of children crying,
and of men running with clattering footsteps
across the great cabin. Through it all he felt the
weight of Francis Billington, who had pitched back
against him, and he saw a little spurt of yellow fire
that licked along the boards. Though he did not
remember snatching a blanket from the bunk, one
was in his hand, and he was down upon the floor,
smothering the flames that would press out beyond
the edges. A powder keg was somewhere near, he
recollected, and he beat out one little jet of flame
with his hand, that smarted fiercely.</p>

<p>It all must have taken a long, long time, but still
the women screamed, and the heavy footsteps had
only just reached the door. The latch rattled beneath
a rough hand, the light streamed into the
cabin, and Miles dropped back against the bunk,
with his arm up to shut out the glare of the lanterns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and the sight, too, of the angry faces in the doorway.
"Francis, Francis," he found himself saying, in a
poor whisper that he realized was not meant for
Francis Billington's ears, "we must 'a' killed some
one."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE NAME OF MILES</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>IN the great cabin two huge, smoky lanterns,
that swayed from the beams overhead, cast
blending white circles in the middle space,
while the corners still remained dusky. Somewhere,
there in the dark, a woman was crying
hysterically, and others, calmer, but with startled,
white faces, were standing beyond the group of men,
who were gathered round the door of the Billingtons'
cabin. Miles saw about him all the faces,
terrified or menacing, but it was blurrily, as in a
dream. He kept telling himself it was all a dream,
an ugly dream, and presently he would awake to
find he had never gone with Francis Billington, and
very glad he would be to awake so.</div>

<p>But the grasp on his neck&mdash;it was big John
Alden, the cooper from Southampton, who had
dragged him out into the great cabin&mdash;was real,
and so, he now found, were the faces of the men
who confronted him. The Elder, William Brewster,
with his gray hair, and grave Governor Carver,
he noted among them, with a hopeless feeling that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
all the majesty of the company was come thither to
judge him. Close by, he heard Francis Billington
crying, with tearful sobs, not dry howls alone, but
Miles dropped his shamed eyes to the floor of the
cabin and did not look at his companion. He
heard Goodman Billington's rough voice, thick with
abuse and threats against his son, and then he
heard the Elder cut him short: "Peace now, friend.
Maybe the lad is hurt."</p>

<p>Just then, from within the Billingtons' cabin,
whence a light smoke still drifted, spoke a quick,
deep voice: "Come you in and lend a hand, Alden.
There is work for two needs despatch. The floor
here is over shoe thick with powder."</p>

<p>"Ay, Captain Standish," the young man answered
promptly, and loosed his hold on Miles's
collar.</p>

<p>There was a little movement in the group of
men, and Master Stephen Hopkins, stepping closer
to the cabin door, peered in and spoke solemnly:
"A full keg of powder broke open! 'Tis by the
mercy of Heaven alone the ship was not blown into
atoms."</p>

<p>"I did not have it in mind to blow up the ship,"
Miles faltered, raising his eyes. "I did but touch
off a squib&mdash;because it would burn bravely."
There the words choked in his throat, for, a little
back from the other men, he caught sight of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
father, and Goodman Rigdale's arms were folded,
his heavy brows drawn close together, and his lips,
beneath his beard, set in a way Miles knew of old.
"I did not mean it," he repeated huskily, and, gazing
at the floor again, began crushing a fold of his
doublet in his hand.</p>

<p>About him there was questioning and answering,
he knew, and he heard Francis whimper: "'Twas
Miles. He touched off squibs, he did."</p>

<p>"Squibs do not make such a noise as that we
heard," Governor Carver interrupted sternly.</p>

<p>"'Twas daddy's fowling piece. Miles Rigdale
and I shot her off, and he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let Miles Rigdale rest," the Elder admonished.
"Do you tell us of Francis Billington."</p>

<p>Bit by bit a fairly accurate story was drawn from
the two boys, though by such slow and woful stages
that before it was ended Captain Miles Standish
and John Alden, with their hands all grimed with
powder, came out from the cabin. Miles stole a
fearful side-glance at the Low Country soldier, who,
being trained in the brutal discipline of the camps,
was likely to prove a harsher judge than the Elder
or the Governor, but, to his relief, he saw the Captain
halt beside Goodman Billington, to whom he
growled out some pithy advice as to the expediency
of keeping his powder covered up and out of reach
of mischievous hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Miles took heart a little then, as much as he
could take heart while he knew Goodman Rigdale
was frowning in the background, and even ventured
to look up when he heard Elder Brewster say, in a
tone which a trace of amusement and much relief
made almost kindly: "Well, well, 'twas no Guy
Fawkes conspiracy, it seems, only the folly of two
scatter-brained lads. Your Excellency scarce will
set them in the bilboes?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I leave it to their fathers to teach them
not to meddle with such tools in future," Governor
Carver answered gravely; and thereupon, with a
surly mutter or so from other fathers in the company
as to what the two culprits deserved to get,
the men scattered to weightier affairs.</p>

<p>As the group thinned, Miles was left face to face
with his father, who, making a curt sign for him to
come after, led the way to the door of the cabin.
Miles felt queer and empty at the pit of his stomach,
and his fingers trembled as he began unhooking his
doublet, but he followed along bravely. His eyes
were still downcast, and, as he stepped, he counted
the planks in the flooring and tried to think of
nothing but their number.</p>

<p>Out in the darkness of the forward deck his
father gave him such punishment as he looked for,&mdash;a
beating with a rope's end, so hard that Miles had
to set his teeth tight and clench his hands to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from crying. Once, in the midst, Goodman Rigdale
stayed his arm, and in the instant's cessation Miles,
standing in his shirt-sleeves, felt the wind from
across the harbor strike cold on his hot flesh, that
was quivering with the blows. "That is for that
you near destroyed the ship," his father spoke,
gravely and without anger. "Now I must flog
you for that you disobeyed me, and had to do
with one of those Billington imps."</p>

<p>The second whipping ended, Miles huddled on
his doublet, stiffly and awkwardly, glad of the darkness
that hid his face. Goodman Rigdale was
speaking again: "And ere you lie down to-night,
my son, remember to give thanks unto God that
by His mercy He has preserved you from being
cast into His presence with the deaths of all that
are within this ship upon your soul."</p>

<p>Miles did not quite follow the words, but, with
a sense that he was the chiefest of sinners, and with
a keen realization that his back and sides were
smarting, he gulped out an unsteady "Yes, sir,"
and blindly fled away.</p>

<p>Aft of the foremast, as he stumbled uncertainly,
he ran against a woman, and at once he knew it was
his mother. In an unformed way he was aware that
she had been waiting to comfort him, and at each
blow had suffered more than he. Her voice was
quavering now, though she tried hard to keep her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
everyday tone: "Come, come down to the cabin
now. Father has shot a bird, and I've made a broth
to our supper. Come, deary, it is turning chill here."</p>

<p>Shaking off the hand she laid on his arm, Miles
broke away and ran to the mainmast, where the
hatchway yawned. Slipping and swinging on the
steep ladder, he descended headlong; he was not
going to his father's cabin, nor did he know whither
he was going, only that he wanted to be by himself.
On the orlop deck he halted an instant before passing
down into the hold; below, there would be
many people, while here, for the moment, he was
alone. He stood blinking at the dim lantern that
hung by the ladder, till slowly it grew blurry to his
eyes, and, raising his bent arm, he hid his face.</p>

<p>It seemed only a moment before he heard someone
come tramping up from the hold, and felt a
hand on his shoulder. He was turned round; he
had to look up; and he saw, standing over him,
Master Hopkins, very grim and stern, as was his
wont. "I am glad to see these tears of repentance,
Miles Rigdale," he spoke severely.</p>

<p>Miles wriggled out of his hold. "I am not
repentant," he cried. "I wish I <i>had</i> blown <i>you</i> up.
Now you can go bid my father flog me again."
With that he dodged the hand Hopkins put out
to detain him, and, jumping over some coils of
rope, scrambled away out of reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Clambering over the chests and kegs that were
placed upon the orlop, he paused only when he
reached the next cleared space, by the forward
hatchway that led to the gunroom. There it was
all dark, a comfortable, thick blackness, and, to
make it safer and lonelier, he crept under a table
that was stored among other household stuff.</p>

<p>For a moment he sat panting, and listened to the
lap, lap of the waves upon the side of the ship and
to his own heavy breathing, but he heard no sound
of any one's pursuing him. Doubtless Master Hopkins
had gone away to tell every one that he was
crying and repentant, Miles tormented himself; no
matter, he was never coming out to be jeered at
and preached to; he would stay under the table
forever, and he would not shed another tear to
please them.</p>

<p>So he sat, rigid and still, and each moment grew
more keenly aware that he was sore from his beating,
that his head ached, and his burnt hand throbbed,
and his heart was big with a great burden of shame.
Of a sudden, in the stillness and dark, he heard a sob.
Then he found it was himself, lying with his head
buried in his arms against the crosspiece that braced
the legs of the table, and crying helplessly.</p>

<p>He had lost track of the minutes, but he had lain
there a long time, he knew, for his arms were numb
with the pressure of the crosspiece against them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and his throat ached with much sobbing, when he
caught the sound of a footstep on the planking of
the orlop. At the same moment, light beat against
his smarting eyelids, and, opening his eyes, he raised
his head to look.</p>

<p>The edges of the table under which he crouched
were silhouetted blackly against the yellow lantern-glow,
which crept midway into his shelter. Following
with his eyes along the light, he could see
beyond the table the joinings of the planks of the
floor, a bit of the ladder that led to the main
deck, and by the ladder, in shadow as the lantern
was raised, the lower part of a man's body.</p>

<p>Miles stared breathlessly at the commonplace
leather shoes and kersey breeches,&mdash;all the rest the
table hid from his view,&mdash;while he strove to hold
back a sob that was halfway up his throat. It
would out, but he tried to turn it into a sneeze,
which ended in a mournful, indefinable gurgle.</p>

<p>Instantly the light of the lantern, swinging round,
swept almost into his face, and a deep voice commanded:
"Come out hither."</p>

<p>Miles sat up, tense and braced. "Is it you, Captain
Standish?" he asked, in a small voice. Not
that, to his knowledge, Miles Standish had ever
hurt any one, but he was a brusque, peremptory
man, reputed of a fiery temper; it was for this,
probably, that Master Hopkins had sent him hither,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
as one fitted to deal out further punishment to such
a criminal as Miles Rigdale.</p>

<p>"Come out, and you'll speedily find if 'tis I,"
Standish's voice rejoined grimly.</p>

<p>Miles rubbed his sleeve across his eyes, the rough
frieze hurting them rarely, then dubiously crept from
his shelter. The straight course was to crawl toward
the light, but to go that way would land him squarely
at the Captain's feet,&mdash;a last touch of ignominy that
he could not endure. So he scrambled painfully
over the crosspieces and round the table-legs, till he
came out upon the open floor the width of the table-top
from the enemy.</p>

<p>"It's naught but you, is it?" the Captain greeted
him, and turned the lantern so the light fell full
upon him.</p>

<p>The boy struggled hastily to his feet. "Ay, sir,"
he nodded, without speaking or looking up.</p>

<p>The other drew a step nearer. "You're one
of the knaves who tried to blow up the <i>Mayflower</i>,
are you not?" he questioned sternly. "Did you
steal down here to fire the magazine and finish the
work?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I did not go for to blow up the ship, sir,"
Miles pleaded, raising his eyes. With amazed relief,
he saw that, for all his gruff tone, the Captain
looked more amused than angry.</p>

<p>Standish must have taken closer note of him, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
for he asked abruptly: "You're John Rigdale's lad,
are you not?"</p>

<p>"I am Miles Rigdale."</p>

<p>The lantern was lowered suddenly. "My namesake,
are you? Do you not think, sirrah, you bear
too good a name to drag it into a powder-burning
matter such as this?"</p>

<p>"I do not hold it a good name," Miles burst out.
"I would they had called me plain Jack."</p>

<p>"Wherefore, pray you?"</p>

<p>"Miles is no name at all," the boy hesitated, between
shyness and the desire to vent a long-standing
resentment. "It makes me think of the stone in our
village that said: 'Thirteen miles to London.'"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, lad! Have you no Latin?"</p>

<p>Miles slipped one hand under the edge of the
table against which he leaned, and picked at a splinter
he found there, while he stammered: "N&mdash;no, sir.
There was no school in our village, and, had there
been, my father could not spare me from the farm.
I must help him, for I'm mighty strong for my
years," he added gravely. "And I never want to go
sit in a school, either. I am glad there will be no
schools here in the plantation, not till I'm a man and
can do as I will. I hold that is the best part of all in
planting a colony, except the lions and the savages."</p>

<p>"And what do you think to do with the lions and
savages, Miles Rigdale?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fight 'em, sir."</p>

<p>Captain Standish chuckled softly in his beard.
"You'll fight 'em, eh? 'Tis a great pity, in truth,
no one has told you what name you bear. You
should know that Miles in the Latin tongue signifies
'a soldier.'"</p>

<p>Miles forgot that his cheeks were tear-stained and
his eyes swollen, and looked up happily into the
speaker's face. "I am right glad of that," he announced.
"'Tis a good enough name, after all."
He was sorely tempted to ask the Captain if he had
been named that after he proved himself a soldier in
the wars, or if they named him first and he grew
to it afterward, but he concluded that would be over-bold.</p>

<p>Though, after all, he began to doubt if Captain
Standish were such a terrible body. He looked
pleasant enough now, as he stood in the lantern light,&mdash;a
stocky, square-shouldered man of some six and
thirty years, with yellow-brown hair and beard, and
eyes so deep set under his brows Miles could not tell
their color. The linen bands at his neck and wrists
were small and plain, and along the sides of his
doublet of dark maroon kersey the rubbing of armor
had worn down the cloth. He was not so fine
a gentleman, doubtless, as young Master Edward
Winslow, but he looked the man of war, through
and through, and, moreover, he neither scolded nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
preached at a small sinner; Miles began to be glad
in his heart that he bore the same name as the
Captain.</p>

<p>"So, after all, you're content to be named 'Soldier'
Rigdale?" Standish suddenly read the expression
of his face.</p>

<p>"'Tis a soldier that I mean to be," Miles confessed.
"I like the smell of powder."</p>

<p>"So it seems," the Captain answered, in the dryest
possible tone, and then, as Miles's cheeks began
to burn, went on hastily: "Which was it, you or
the Billington lad, put out the fire? We found
the blanket on the floor of the cabin."</p>

<p>"Mayhap 'twas I. I do not recall it clearly."</p>

<p>The Captain reached out his hand, and, taking
Miles by a fold of the doublet-sleeve, lifted his arm.
"No doubt 'twas you," he said; "you've blistered
your hand here."</p>

<p>"I know. It aches," Miles whispered, with a
sudden husky dropping of his voice.</p>

<p>"You'd better go to your mother straightway
and ask her to put oil on it; that will soon draw
out the fire."</p>

<p>"I can't," Miles gulped. "I can never go out
among the people again. When they all think I
tried to blow them up,&mdash;and when every one will
know I have been newly whipped. I shall stay
here forever." His voice died down as he spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the last: it did not sound manly, but uncommon
silly.</p>

<p>"You'd get mighty hungry if you did," the soldier
answered him coolly. "You're going to your
mother now, my man. Run along with you. I've
to go on down into the gunroom, but I'll light you
up the ladder."</p>

<p>Miles gave a tremulous gasp of resignation, and
scuffed slowly to the foot of the ladder, where he
paused and smeared the back of his hand across his
cheeks; then turned to his companion. "Captain
Standish," he hesitated; then, as it was the only
possible way of learning what he wished to know
before he showed himself among the company, he
blurted out desperately, "Will you tell me, is my
face clean?"</p>

<p>Captain Standish looked down at him with a
funny expression in his eyes. "I think 'twill serve
in a half light, if you slip directly into your father's
cabin."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," Miles answered; then added
hastily, "You see, there was something flew into
my eye, and one that did not know might think&mdash;I
had been crying."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THIEVISH HARBOR</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>ONE sharp December afternoon, a week and
a day after the Pilgrim leaders went forth
the third time to seek a place for settlement,
Love Brewster and his little brother Wrestling
climbed down to the cabins beneath the main
deck to visit their playmate, Dolly Rigdale. The
cubby where Dolly and Miles and their father and
mother had lived during the two months of the
voyage over the sea and the five weeks of exploration
that followed, was a dim box of a place, but
the little boys liked to visit it, not only to talk with
Dolly, who was nearer their age than most of the
children in the company, but to see Trug and
Solomon.</div>

<p>Trug was the big, grizzled mastiff, who had
guarded the house and the cattle faithfully for so
many years that even stern John Rigdale had not
the heart to leave him to strangers; and Solomon,
with the wise eyes of royal yellow, was the fat
house-cat, whom Dolly had insisted on bringing
with her to the new home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it had been my pet, 'twould 'a' had to bide
in England," Miles had told himself, in one bitter,
jealous moment, of which he was justly ashamed.
For, without question, Goodman Rigdale cared
equally for his two children, only he held Miles,
being a stubborn chip of manhood, needed frequent
beatings, such as the Scriptures enjoined on good
fathers to give their sons, whereas Dolly was just a
little wench, with gray eyes like her mother, so she
received very gentle whippings and triumphantly
lugged Solomon on shipboard.</p>

<p>The sleek, striped creature lay beside her now,
for Dolly, still ailing with her cough, was resting on
the bunk beneath the blankets. Wrestling Brewster,
a big-eyed, silent child, sat by her, and, sorry
to tell, joined forces with the little girl in rumpling
poor Solomon's fur. "You are the best pussy,"
Dolly purred meantime, and, either because of her
flattery or because the warm blankets were comfortable,
the cat made no movement to leave her.</p>

<p>Ordinarily Miles sniffed at the conversation of
eight-year-olds, such as his sister, but this afternoon
he gladly lingered in the cabin, for the accomplishments
of the Brewster lads were amazing enough to
lift them to the rank of companions. Both could
jabber Dutch quite as fast as Miles could speak
English, and Love, the talkative one, could tell
wonderful stories of the queer Low Country city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of Leyden, where all his short life had been spent.
It was of Leyden he spoke now, sitting beside
Miles on the turned-up mattress, where at night
Goodman Rigdale and his son slept, and Miles,
with a question here and there to draw out what he
sought, listened again to the story of the Pilgrims.</p>

<p>Love had good reason to know it well, for his
father, Elder Brewster, had been from the first one
of the leaders of the little company. He had given
all his substance to help the cause of that faith
which the bishops of the great Established Church
of England held it right to crush out; he had suffered
imprisonment for the sake of that faith; and
finally, that he and his friends might worship God
as they thought best, had gone into exile in Holland.</p>

<p>There for twelve years the Pilgrim church held
its own, though its members, for all their efforts
to support themselves in that strange country, fared
hardly and poorly. Good Deacon Fuller, the physician,
had been glad to earn his living as a say or
serge maker; Master William Bradford had been
a maker of fustian; and the Elder had maintained
his family and aided his poorer companions by
teaching English to Danish and German gentlemen,
and later by printing English books.</p>

<p>Love told also of Master Carver, the recently
elected governor of the company, who had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
his whole fortune to the Pilgrim cause; and he
spoke of gallant Master Edward Winslow, who,
travelling in the Low Countries with his newly
married wife, had come to know and to respect the
Pilgrim folk and finally to cast in his lot with theirs.
And, best of all, Love could tell of Captain Standish.</p>

<p>There the boy turned to what Miles had been
waiting to hear, and be sure that now he eagerly
drank in each word: how the Captain came of a
great family in Lancashire, where he had a vast
estate which his kinsfolk had taken from him,&mdash;so
Love had once heard him say to the Elder; how
he had fought bravely against the wicked Spaniards,
as far back as the time of Queen Bess, when Miles
Standish was a very young man indeed; and how,
of a sudden, he had come with his young wife and
joined himself to the Pilgrims, why, none could
say, for he was "not of our faith," Love gravely
quoted the older people.</p>

<p>That last did not greatly displease Miles, perhaps
because his own father was rather a Puritan
than an ardent Separatist, as those were called who,
like the Pilgrims of Leyden, broke off all communion
with the Established Church. Goodman
John Rigdale grumbled about the bishops and the
vestments of the clergymen and other matters which
Miles neither heeded nor comprehended, but, for
all his grumbling, as often as the law insisted, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and his household went to church. One of the first
and liveliest recollections of childhood which Miles
kept, was of how the red light from the painted
windows that his father hated used to shift along
the dark oak of the old pews.</p>

<p>Lately, though, John Rigdale had spoken out
too openly against the service book, and there had
been a citation before the ecclesiastical court. Miles
scarcely understood the matter, but he knew that
Dun-face, the pet heifer, had been sold to pay a
fine, and that their landlord, swearing that he was
too good a Church of England man to suffer a
pestilent Separatist hold a farm of him, had refused
to renew the lease, bought long ago by Miles's
grandfather, which now ran out.</p>

<p>Then had come Master Stephen Hopkins, the
London tanner, whose first wife had been a distant
cousin of John Rigdale's, and he had talked of the
new country over seas, where a man might have
land and a farm of his own for the asking and worship
to please his conscience, not the king's bishops.
Master Hopkins had already made up his mind to
embark with the people from Leyden; he had met
their agent, Master Cushman, and he was acquainted
with some of the London merchants who had
formed a partnership with the Leyden people, the
Londoners to furnish money to pay the expenses
of the long voyage, the Separatists to give themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and their families to defend and till the plantation
thus gained.</p>

<p>In the end, Master Hopkins's statements were
so weighty that Goodman Rigdale followed his example.
The stout farm horse and the cows and the
pigs were all led away to market, and Dolly cried
over each one; and Goodwife Rigdale, too, wept a
little when most of the bits of furniture were sold.
But Miles thought it all very merry and stirring,&mdash;the
breaking up of the home he had known, the
journey to Southampton, all amidst new sights and
sounds, and the ship, and the long voyage over the
sea, till the <i>Mayflower</i> dropped anchor off Cape Cod.</p>

<p>He was more than a bit weary of the voyage and
the ship now, however, as he sat on the turned-up
mattress in his father's stuffy little cabin. The
dead air was cold without being bracing, and Miles
broke short Love's discourse on the journey of the
Leyden Pilgrims into England, by springing up
and stamping his chilled feet.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a shrewd cold day," said his companion.
"See!" He puffed at the air, and his breath made
a little white cloud. "Maybe we'd best go up on
deck and run."</p>

<p>At that word the two older boys turned to the
door, but Wrestling shook his head and, pressing
closer to Dolly, whispered: "Before I go, I want
that you show me the Indian basket."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Miles overheard, and delayed to draw from beneath
the bunk the deal box in which the treasure
was kept. Wrestling was so young that he seemed
hardly more than a baby, and as a baby Miles had
a kindly, protecting feeling for him; when he rose
with the box he opened it so the little boy might
have the first sight. Within lay a tiny basket all
of silk grass, pictured on which in black and white
were birds and flowers of a curious pattern.</p>

<p>"Did your father truly bring it from the Indians?"
Love asked.</p>

<p>"He brought it home to me," Dolly explained
proudly. "It was in an Indian house, and my
father found it when he went ashore with Captain
Standish. And so he brought it to me."</p>

<p>Wrestling touched the fragile thing gingerly. "I
wish our father fought the Indians once," he murmured.</p>

<p>"It is better to be an Elder," Love rebuked him
sternly; then added, lest Dolly's feelings be hurt,
"though, to be sure, there can be but one Elder in
a company. The rest must be fighting men, must
they not, Miles?"</p>

<p>But Miles gave no heed; for just then the sound
of soft footsteps made him glance to the open door,
at which the light drifted in, and there, standing on
the threshold, he saw his mother.</p>

<p>Years afterward, when he looked back, Miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
realized Goodwife Rigdale had been a young woman
then, not above thirty, but in those days it seemed
to him she must be old, because she was his mother;
he even wondered that she had not hair streaked
with gray, like Mistress Brewster. Mothers were
always old, he generalized rashly, just as they were
always gentle-spoken and full of kindness; only
that last judgment he revoked, after he came aboard
the <i>Mayflower</i> and heard Goodwife Billington, a true
London virago, rail at her sons and saw her cuff
them.</p>

<p>But his own mother was not to be belittled by
naming her with Ellen Billington; she was everything
that was good and to be loved, even if she did
not wear such a brave gown as Mistress Winslow,
nor have such pink cheeks as Mistress Standish.
Miles drew away from the bunk, against which he
had been leaning, to make room for her to sit,
though he did it awkwardly, because Love and
Wrestling were looking.</p>

<p>"I'll bide a bit now with my little maid," she
said, as she drew the blankets more closely about
Dolly. "You'll want to be running up on deck
now, I can guess, deary, and Love and Wrestling
too, if Mistress Brewster will suffer it."</p>

<p>"Mother, is the shallop in sight?" Miles cried
eagerly. For, since the exploring party sailed forth
a week before, there had come so great a storm that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hearts aboard the <i>Mayflower</i> were not a little anxious
for their welfare.</p>

<p>"They've made out a sail to the southward, I
heard the talk run. Go you and learn further,
Miles. Your father will be on deck too."</p>

<p>Miles reddened a little; why would she speak as
if he were a young boy, to need his father? "Come,
lads," he said, in a very old tone, to hide his mortification,
and led the way from the cabin. As he
passed out at the door, he heard a sorrowful wail
from Dolly: "O me! Mammy, can I not run
about with them soon?"</p>

<p>But Miles forgot Dolly's woes and all, when he
clambered into the bracing air of the deck, whither
the most of the hale ones of the company had, like
himself, bustled to watch the approaching shallop.
Shreds of dappled cloud half obscured the east, but
low in the west the sun was cold and yellow, and its
light flecked the water and made the sail of the distant
craft gleam like gold.</p>

<p>Miles stared till for very dazzle he could see no
longer, then turned his gaze inboard, where it rested
on the slender figure of a woman, who leaned against
the mainmast. When the light got out of his eyes,
he perceived it was Mistress Rose Standish, who,
while he was still gazing on her, came to the bulwark
beside him, but, without seeming to see him,
stood looking toward the shallop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Once and again Miles glanced up at her, thinking
how bonny she was with the flush on her cheeks
and her brown hair straying from beneath her hood
across her forehead; and then he grew suddenly
hot, for she chanced to look down, and their eyes
met. He drew away bashfully and stared again at
the shallop; the sun had now dropped lower, so the
waves around it were sombre, but within the boat
sparkled a gleam of light on metal armor. Miles
almost thought to be able to distinguish the forms
of the men, and presently their faces. "Yon is the
Captain," he broke out, half aloud.</p>

<p>"Do you see him, too?" Mistress Standish
spoke, as if he had addressed her.</p>

<p>"That's he, by the mast, with the steel corselet."</p>

<p>She looked down again, and the boy noted her
eyes were moist, though she smiled as she said:
"You seem to know the Captain very well, sir."</p>

<p>"I'd know him anywhere," Miles answered earnestly.
"You understand, he was right kind to me."</p>

<p>Then he broke off speech, for the shallop was
now fairly alongside, and the men in her were calling
to those on shipboard greetings and questions
and answers. Mistress Standish moved quickly
toward the gangway, and Miles saw her meet the
Captain, when he clambered up the ladder.</p>

<p>Next after him came Master William Bradford,
and suddenly it struck with a shock on Miles's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
remembrance that Mistress Bradford was dead,
drowned alongside the <i>Mayflower</i> on the very day
after the shallop sailed, and her body carried away
among the waves. Master Bradford, for all the
weariness in his movements, looked cheerful and
hopeful as he gained the deck, and his eyes went
glancing over the women gathered there with such
a certainty of meeting one that, child though he
was, Miles realized something of the pity of it.</p>

<p>But after Elder Brewster had led Master Bradford
away, the horror and the pity slipped quickly
from Miles. Drawing over closer to the gangway
ladder, he stood watching the rest of the shallop's
company scramble to the deck, and, listening to
every scrap of speech, was soon eager as any of the
other boys in questioning the sailors and Hopkins's
man, Dotey.</p>

<p>The minutes ran on till dim twilight had darkened
upon the water, when at last, bursting with
news, Miles clambered down again to Goodwife
Rigdale in the cabin. "They've found a place for
us to settle, mother," he announced, barely within
the door.</p>

<p>Goodwife Rigdale hushed him with a finger on
her lips; Dolly was asleep, so he must speak
softly.</p>

<p>Miles curled himself up on the floor at his
mother's feet, with his elbow on her knee, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
whispered: "'Tis at a place called Thievish Harbor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, that's an ill name," commented the Goodwife.</p>

<p>"'Tis because a savage stole a harpoon from a
ship's boat that once put in there to truck, so says
Robert Coppin, the pilot. It lies across a great
bay here, and there are fair green islands and many
brooks and cleared land and tall trees. We are
going thither, all of us, mother. The ship is to
sail so soon as the wind favors. And if they like
of it on further look, we'll go ashore and stay. I
want to go ashore again," he ended wistfully; "the
week's out that father said I must stay on the ship.
Won't you beg him take me ashore first thing when
we come thither, mother?"</p>

<p>The flickering light that reached them from the
lantern hung outside the cabin door was blotted
out then, as Goodman Rigdale himself came in.
Miles dared ask no favors of him directly, however,
but, scrambling to his feet, stood silent and unobtrusive,
though he listened eagerly to all his father
had to say of Thievish Harbor, which he called
Plymouth. "So it is named on the maps that
were drawn by Captain Smith," he said, to which
Goodwife Rigdale answered quickly: "I am glad
for the name. Do you not have in mind, John,
how kindly the people at our English Plymouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
dealt by us when we had to put in at their harbor?"</p>

<p>But this new Plymouth in America bore little
resemblance to Plymouth in Devonshire, as Miles
found, to his surprise, when he had his first sight
of the place where the company was to settle. It
was on the afternoon of the day succeeding the
return of the shallop that, the wind at last favoring,
the <i>Mayflower</i> steered her course for the bay of
Plymouth. The sunshine was strong and clear, and
the air mild, so Goodwife Rigdale suffered Dolly
come up on deck, where, well wrapped in a cloak,
she stood between her mother and Miles.</p>

<p>Others in plenty, all the passengers who could
walk about, were watching for a glimpse of the new
home, but Miles, in his eagerness, scarcely heeded
his companions. He strained his eyes to see the
headlands, brave with evergreen, loom higher and
higher, and ran to question his friend, Giles Hopkins,
who had been talking with the sailors, as to
what they were. Giles explained that the one on
the left was not the mainland, but a well-wooded
point, and on the right yonder the farther of the
two islands, with the trees, was where the exploring
party had spent their Sabbath.</p>

<p>By the time Miles returned to his mother with
the news, they were running in between the point
and the islands, and presently, well within the harbor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
they dropped anchor in a safe mooring ground.
All about them were headlands and islands; far to
the right, across the bay, rose a great hill; and
just over opposite where the ship lay a broad
space of open land, with high hills behind, could
be made out.</p>

<p>"Yonder's where we'll settle," Miles assured his
mother.</p>

<p>"I see no houses," protested Dolly. "I thought
there would be cottages, maybe. Must we lie in
the woods, mammy?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! We'll build houses," scoffed Miles;
he would have blushed to own that, half unconsciously,
he, too, had cherished the fancy of seeing
on the New England shore straggling streets and
tiny cottages, as in old Plymouth.</p>

<p>"You'll build houses, Miles?" teased his sister.</p>

<p>"Father and I and all the men," the boy bragged.
"Build them of great logs. Then in the spring will
come a ship with horses and cows and sheep, and
we'll have farms, just as we had at home."</p>

<p>"With a hedge round the dooryard?" Dolly
questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes, and meadow-land and ploughed fields.
We'll have all in order when the frost leaves the
ground," Miles answered confidently.</p>

<p>Then he looked up at his mother, and was
astonished to see that for once her eyes were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
on her children, but on the empty shore over opposite.
Her face was wistful, and it came on Miles
that perhaps she was not as interested in the farm
concerns as he, who was a man, so he said quickly:
"And you can have a garden here, mother, full
of rosemary and daffadowndillies, just as at home.
Maybe you'll not have to labor so hard here," he
added more vaguely, not quite understanding her
silence.</p>

<p>She smiled a little then. "That's a good lad,
Miles," she said, putting her arm about his shoulders;
then she bade him go to his mates if he would,
and she led Dolly back to the cabin.</p>

<p>Miles stood alone, gazing at the home-shore and
wondering where his father's farm would lie. Still
thinking on it, he was turning toward the hatchway,
when he almost ran into Goodman Rigdale. "O
father," Miles broke out before he thought, "may
I not go with you when we begin our farm? I'll
conduct me well and be obedient."</p>

<p>He stopped, surprised at his own forwardness,
and he was more surprised when his father, looking
down at him gravely, said without chiding: "Our
farm? Ay, Miles, so soon as there is work to do
on shore you shall come with me and bear a hand."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>HEWERS OF WOOD AND DRAWERS OF WATER</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"TO-MORROW I am going ashore."
Thus Miles Rigdale proclaimed, from
his perch on the bunk in his father's
cabin, to all who might choose to hear.</div>

<p>"'Tis the forty and third time you've said that
in the last sennight," Ned Lister answered dryly.
He was lounging in the cabin door, shirt-sleeved
and shivering, while Goodwife Rigdale repaired his
doublet; Mistress Hopkins, to whom the task
ordinarily fell, lay ill, and her stepdaughter, Constance,
was so busied that, to relieve her, Alice
Rigdale had taken the young man and his mending
off her hands.</p>

<p>"Why do you not put on your cloak, if you be
cold, Ned Lister?" Dolly spoke up.</p>

<p>"Because 'tis too much labor to fetch it, Puss,"
Ned answered, whereat Miles laughed, and the
Goodwife's brows puckered; another might have
said it was because the sewing gave her trouble, but
Miles, who felt uncomfortably that his mother disapproved
of Ned as a scatter-brained, reckless fellow,
guessed that she had not liked that last speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>He was sure of his guess when she hastened to
change the subject: "Does it still rain upon deck,
Edward?"</p>

<p>"Rain and naught else; the third day of it now,
yet by the look it might pour on for a week."</p>

<p>"And my daddy's yonder in the wet on shore,"
murmured Dolly, pressing close against her mother's
knee, and the Goodwife sewed more slowly, with her
eyes downcast.</p>

<p>But Miles burst into lamentation: "I think they
might 'a' taken me ashore. Since we came into
Plymouth Harbor they've explored and explored,
and never suffered me to come, but they took Giles
Hopkins with them. And now the randevous is
built on shore, and some of the men are staying
there, it has rained and rained so I cannot go to
them. But I'm going to-morrow, the very next
time the shallop sails."</p>

<p>"To be sure you shall," Lister answered, as he
scrambled into his mended doublet. "I'll take you
along with me."</p>

<p>Then he swaggered away jauntily, as if he had
promised ample service in return for his mending,
and Goodwife Rigdale, with a bit of a sigh, said
softly to Miles: "'Tis well meant of Edward Lister
to see you safe ashore, but when you are there, remember,
you are to stay with your father, not go
roving with him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Miles's satisfaction at Ned's offer was a bit tempered
by her words, but he lost the remembrance
of them next morning, when he saw the sun was rising
clear and the shallop would go shoreward. At
once he clattered down to the cabin to get his cap
and mittens, and Trug, who must go with him;
then ran up on deck again, where, in the chill sunlight,
the men were laboring briskly to load the
shallop. Miles watched them while they put in
the felling-axes and handsaws and hammers, all the
tools that were to build the new town of Plymouth,
and the biscuit and salt beef and pease that were to
form the workers' rations.</p>

<p>About the time the labor was ended, Ned sauntered
up to the gangway, and, seeing Miles, very
speedily helped him clamber down the ladder, and
made Trug leap after him. Master Isaac Allerton,
who was settled comfortably in the stern, grumbled
at burdening the shallop with children and curs, so
Miles put his arms about Trug, and, cuddling down
in the bottom of the boat, made himself as still and
small as possible lest, after all, the company, thinking
better of it, bid him scramble up the gangway
ladder again.</p>

<p>But the time for that was past, for the shallop,
with her sail hanging sluggish, had crept surely out
from the lee of the <i>Mayflower</i>, and now, catching the
light breeze, actually stood in to the shore. Miles forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the discomfort of his seat among the tools while
he gazed toward the approaching coast line, where
was to be his home. Behind him the sun was up,
and the hills that rose away inland from the harbor
were bright in the cold, yellow radiance, and the
water and the sky that spread about him were both
very blue. He glanced back over his shoulder at
the dreary old <i>Mayflower</i>, and was surprised to find
that, as the sun struck athwart her patched sails,
even she was beautiful.</p>

<p>Then the movement of those about him, and
the sound of waves crunching on the shingle, made
him look forward again. Under the shelter of a
high bluff, where a great boulder ran out into the
water, he saw those standing who had kept the randevous,
and the randevous itself, a rude hut of
boughs. In his eagerness Miles jumped up, and
Trug, springing up too, began to bark, but no one
took note or scolded, for the men were busied in
running the shallop in alongside the rock, and some,
leaping over the gunwale, were already splashing
through the shallow water to the beach.</p>

<p>Ned and Giles Hopkins made the shore thus,
so Miles must do the like, and came to land all
drenched and dripping. But it was land,&mdash;good,
stable, brown earth, not the hateful, rolling ship,&mdash;he
had beneath his feet, and, in the delight of the
long unused sensation, he forgot he was wet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
chilled, forgot his father awaited him, and there was
work to do. He knew only that far and near the
shore stretched widely, where a boy could run, so,
for choice, he set his face to the bluff that towered
above the landing.</p>

<p>Up and up, through the keen, dry bushes, that
whipped his hands and face so he laughed in the
mere delight of struggling with them, he fought his
way till he came breathless to the bare summit.
All about him dazzled the blue of the harbor and
of the unclouded sky, and yonder on his right,
through its fringe of bushes, shone the blue of what
seemed a cove. Down the hill rushed Miles, with
Trug leaping and barking at his heels, and paused
only on the shore of a great brook, that, flowing
out between steep bluffs, widened into the sea.</p>

<p>Another was before him there, his distant kinsman,
Giles Hopkins, who, for all he was a sober lad of sixteen,
was a good comrade to the younger boy. He
now bade Miles come upstream to the spring the men
had found on their last exploration, and Miles very
readily followed him through the scrubby undergrowth,
where the cove narrowed on the left hand,
and on the right a high bluff kept pace with the
boys. "It's on that bluff they mean to set the
houses," Giles explained, over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Then we'll have this big stream in our dooryards,"
cried Miles. "Won't that be brave? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
shall build me a raft, and sail to those wooded hills
on the other side whenever I choose. Though,
maybe, Indians dwell there," he added, with a dubious
glance at Giles; he did not wish to seem afraid,
but, though he intended to be a soldier, he did not
purpose to fight without a musket and a long sword,
and he wondered how much farther from the shore
his leader would venture.</p>

<p>But speedily his wonder had an end, for, breaking
through a thicket of leafless alders, Giles halted
at a little cavity within the sand of the riverbank,
where the spring of sweet water bubbled up. Down
lay Miles on the turf, and, using his hand for a cup,
swallowed his first draught of New England water.
"'Tis better than the brackish stuff we have on
shipboard," he said, as he wiped his wet hands on
his wet doublet.</p>

<p>"The savages must have known the spot," answered
the experienced Giles. "We found this
path worn down hither from the bluff, and see, here
is a line of stepping-stones across the brook."</p>

<p>Miles glanced about him, half nervously, lest
along the path or across the stones he see one of
their former savage passengers approaching. He
was at heart relieved when, as Giles led the way up
the bluff, he heard in the distance the sound of an
axe crashing on a tree trunk. Giles did not turn
toward the sound, however, but went plodding on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
uphill, for above the bluff a second summit reared
itself steeply. Miles panted in his trail, endlessly
upward, it seemed, till at last he stood exhausted
on a lofty hilltop, whence, far as the sea spread out
before him, he beheld the wooded uplands roll away
to westward.</p>

<p>Giles was explaining wisely what a proper place
this hill was for a fort, and how Captain Standish
had advised the company mount upon it guns, which
should command to southward the spring, and
toward the harbor the landing place and the houses,
which were to be built along the river bluff, when
Master Hopkins and John Rigdale, tramping
thither, ended their sons' holiday.</p>

<p>"Is this the way you would work, Miles?"
Goodman Rigdale asked sternly, and, fearing lest
the next word sentence him to return at once to
the <i>Mayflower</i>, Miles ran eagerly about the task
they set him.</p>

<p>All day he tugged chips and branches for the fire
at the randevous, but it was work on land, in the
free air, where a boy could shout as much as he
wished, so he never realized he was weary till night
came. He had to pack off to the ship with the
other boys and near half the men, but he had no
chance to grumble at this, as did some of his mates,
for, once aboard the shallop, he leaned against Ned
Lister and fell half asleep. Only when the shallop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
scraped the ship's side did he awake to stagger up
the gangway ladder and stumble away to tell Dolly
and his mother of the wonders he had seen ashore.</p>

<p>Next day, being Sunday, no work was done, and
the next day, being Christmas, Miles, who remembered
what a time of merrymaking that was at home,
thought he must idle again. But here on Christmas,
from sunrise to sunset, it was all stern work.
"We stain this virgin soil with no Popish holydays,"
Master Hopkins said grimly, and, though the rest
did not exult in words, they labored with double
fervor to show they did no honor to the day.</p>

<p>Miles had his part to do on shore that Christmas
and in the days that followed, though it was a
different part from that he had hoped to have.
When he talked to his mother and Dolly of building
cottages, he had fancied that perhaps he would
be allowed to sit high up on a ridgepole and drive
nails. He knew he would enjoy doing that, but
in practice he was set less pleasant tasks: he ran
errands, not only for his father, but for every man
who chose to send him; he fetched water up the
steep bluff from the spring to the workers; and he
carried firewood from where the choppers labored
upon the bluff to where the first house was building.</p>

<p>On occasion he even tended the fire and saw that
the porridge did not burn, and more than once was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
sent to carry a portion of the food to the men who,
unable to rise and get their rations, lay ill in the
half-built log cabins. The numbers of these sick
ever multiplied, for the close quarters and bad food
aboard the <i>Mayflower</i> had caused a fever to break
out among her passengers, and the exposure to
which the men and boys often recklessly subjected
themselves increased the roll of the ailing, and, at
last, of the dying.</p>

<p>Miles was sorry, of course, for the men and
women who sickened and died, but it was a sorrow
that did not go deep enough to prevent his enjoying
the open-air life, and the moments of play that
he snatched from his work. For death had not
come near any that he loved; Dolly and Jack
Cooke had been ill, but they were getting better,
and none of his other near acquaintances had been
touched. To be sure, he himself went sneezing
with a great cold, but it meant nothing, any more
than did his father's cough; he did not worry for
it the half as much as he fretted at the dull routine
labors to which he was set.</p>

<p>One day in January he had a hand in more exciting
work, for Ned Lister and Giles Hopkins,
who were going to cut swamp grass for thatch, invited
him to come with them, and Ned even let
him carry his sharp sickle. Ned himself turned all
his effort to bearing a fowling piece, with the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of which, after the grass was cut, he had been bribed
to the afternoon's labor, for he was afflicted with a
hard cough that racked him most piteously when
he was set to any work but hunting.</p>

<p>So soon as they reached the piece of marshy
ground in the deep hollow behind the first range of
hills, where grew the grass they sought, one of those
coughing fits laid hold on Ned. He really wasn't
fit to work, he said, but, when Miles volunteered
to do the task for him, he found energy to direct
the boy's clumsy attempts with the sickle.</p>

<p>Two bundles of grass the workers were expected
to bring home, and Giles cut his, slowly
and soberly, while Ned dallied with Miles, till he
saw his companion had nearly gathered his share.
Then Lister snatched the sickle from Miles, and,
finishing the work in a surprisingly short time for
a sick man, caught up his piece with the exclamation,
"<i>Now</i> we'll go fowling."</p>

<p>Leaving the sickles and the bundles of grass
where they lay, the three picked a path round the
verge of the marsh and climbed westward over the
hills. Last of all Miles trotted along bravely, very
proud that he was one of the company, and full of
interest at passing so far inland. But on the top
of the second long hill, Giles suddenly cried out:
"Look yonder. Is not that smoke?"</p>

<p>Against the dull sky to the west Miles saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
little fine curl of gray, and the question was on his
tongue's end, when Ned Lister anticipated it: "No,
it can be none of our people so far from the shore.
Savages, maybe. Say we go down and see."</p>

<p>Shouldering his fowling piece, he set out jauntily,
and the two boys came stoutly after. They
scrambled down a rough hillslope and through
another level piece, all open and stubbly, westward
still, where the smoke rose. "This land has been
cleared; 'tis true Indian ground here," Ned spoke
suddenly, and halted.</p>

<p>Miles stopped short five paces behind his comrades.
He looked to the hills ahead, where the
bare branches of oak trees stood out clearly against
the afternoon sky. It was a lowering sky, and
night was coming. He glanced behind him, and
saw only the barren wall of hills, no sign of the
harbor or of the <i>Mayflower</i>. Ned and Giles were
looking at each other with a something so dubious
in their faces that Miles felt a griping sensation in
his throat. He wondered if he could find his way
back as he had come, and, doubting it, drew close
to Ned, who had the fowling piece.</p>

<p>Ned was fiddling with the lock of the piece and
he spoke rather sheepishly: "I'm not afraid. But
I'm not going to run into Heaven knows what
with two younkers like you on my shoulders."</p>

<p>"Say we march home, then?" Giles suggested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and straightway, facing round, they retraced their
steps pretty smartly.</p>

<p>Miles was still in the rear, and, as he went, he
studied the long legs of his companions and
thought how much more swiftly they could run
for it, if anything came up behind them. Thinking
so, he forgot to look to his feet, and, as they
descended a gully, fell headlong with a great clattering
of stones. "Wait for me!" he cried, in a sharp,
high voice that did not sound natural.</p>

<p>Ned glanced back, with his face tenser than its
wont. "Here, take the fowling piece, Giles," he
said curtly; then, returning to Miles, he lifted him
to his feet, and, keeping one hand beneath his arm,
helped him to hurry along.</p>

<p>Thus they scurried down the hillside to the
swamp, and, catching up their sickles and the
thatch, pressed on toward the settlement. Not till
they were panting up the landward side of the great
hill and caught the faint sound of hammers in the
street of the half-built town, did Ned suffer the
speed to slacken. "You'll make a gallant soldier
one day, Miley," he said then, and began laughing.
"Though I take it no one of us was afraid; eh,
boys?"</p>

<p>They all agreed they were not in the least frightened,
and some such version Ned must have reported
to Captain Standish, when he told how they had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Indian fires. For next day Miles found himself
quite a hero in the sight of the other lads, because
he had gone far into the woods and walked boldly
right into an encampment of the savages. But
Goodman Rigdale chided his son sternly for such
a harebrained prank, and after that made the boy
stay within his sight while he was on shore.</p>

<p>Miles did not greatly mind, for his father and
Francis Cooke, the father of his playmate Jack,
were now engaged in a delightful work in which he
liked to help. Lately the whole company of the
<i>Mayflower</i> had been divided into nineteen families,
and these two men, who had been placed in one
household, were building together a cottage, high
up on the hillside. His father's house, Miles insisted
upon calling it, though Goodman Rigdale
was at pains to explain to him that the cottage belonged
not to any one man, but to the whole company;
the Pilgrims at Plymouth and the merchants
at London, who had advanced the money for the
voyage, were to hold everything in common till
seven years were up and then divide all equally,
and till then no man could call a house his own.</p>

<p>Still, Miles knew that by and by his mother and
Dolly and Jack Cooke would come ashore, as other
families were coming, and they would live together
in that house, so it seemed the same as if it belonged
to his father. He looked forward to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
time when they would all be under one roof, and
he would be suffered to sleep ashore, for, though
his father passed his nights at the Common House,
there was no room for Miles, who at twilight had
to journey off to the ship. But that arrangement
drew speedily to an end, for the walls of the house,
built of squared logs, soon rose to a good height;
the chimney of sticks and clay was finished; and
at last it was but a question of thatching the roof.</p>

<p>Of a dull afternoon in mid-January Goodman
Rigdale set out to cut swamp grass for the thatch,
and took with him Miles, who had not been so far
afield since his exploit with Ned Lister. They
went steadily up the slope on the shoulder of the
great hill, and there Miles, who had run a little
ahead with Trug, paused to look back proudly at
the stanch, new cottage below. "Those are brave
big logs in our house, are they not, sir?" he broke
out. "'Twill last us a many years."</p>

<p>"That, or whatever house shall fall to us at the
division, will last you all your lifetime," Goodman
Rigdale answered shortly. "And you will lease it
of no man. You'll hold a house and a farm of your
own here one day, Miles."</p>

<p>They tramped on a time in silence, and Miles
was making himself sport by crushing in the scum
of ice on the pools along their path, when his father
spoke suddenly: "You're in a fair way to lead an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
easier life than your father or your grandfather before
you, Miles. And if you be the happier, you
should be so much the better man."</p>

<p>"Ay, sir," Miles answered vaguely, and tipped
back his head to watch a great bird that went flapping
across the sky; he wished his father had
brought along a fowling piece.</p>

<p>When they came to the swamp, Goodman Rigdale
cut down the grass swiftly, and Miles bundled
it, though he found it hard to keep pace with his
father. Goodman Rigdale, being in haste, must at
the last do the work himself, and, while he bundled
the grass, Miles, remembering the stolen pleasures
of his last thatching trip, picked up the sickle and
tried a slash or two on his own account. He managed
to cut his hand, and, though he scarcely felt
the pain, because the hand was cold, he stared in
some fright when he saw the blood come streaking
out.</p>

<p>Goodman Rigdale gave him a rag to tie up the
hurt hand, and also gave him some good advice on the
need of care with edged tools, which Miles did not
think quite called for just then. He tried, however,
not to show any sign of pain, because that always
displeased his father; and, as he thought he had
borne himself quite bravely, he was much hurt, when
Goodman Rigdale, on coming down into the settlement,
said: "Get you to the shallop now, Miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and bide on board the <i>Mayflower</i> till I send for you.
You'll be of no service with your hand cut. Mayhap
you'll be better off with your mother, too.
After all, you are but a young lad."</p>

<p>"As you bid, sir," Miles said, respectfully, but
very stiffly, and walked away down the path to the
landing.</p>

<p>Once he stopped to kick a stone out of his way,
and once, before he rounded the base of the bluff,
something made him face about and look back to
the Common House. His father was standing by
the door, watching him, and Miles, feeling much
rebuked, walked on rapidly. But the image of his
father remained in his mind very clear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>NEWS FROM THE SHORE</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>BECAUSE Miles's hand was hurt, Goodwife
Rigdale made much of him, till he fairly
resented it, for he had grown into the age
where he was sheepish and awkward under open
petting. He soon slipped away from his mother
and the sympathetic Dolly, and went to spend his
time with Jack Cooke, who, during the day, while
his father worked on shore, was glad of company.
The boys had now almost room enough on shipboard
to play satisfactorily, for many of the passengers
had gone ashore; but it must be quiet playing,
for, of those who still remained in their cabins not
a few were ill.</div>

<p>Goodwife Rigdale was busied to and fro in caring
for the sick ones, and, at her bidding, Miles ran
many an errand, to fetch water from the casks on
deck or heat a pot of broth in the ship's galley.
But their joint labor soon ended, for, a few days
after the boy's return to the ship, came a message
from Goodman Rigdale: he was just touched with
the fever, he said, though nothing serious, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
many lay sick ashore, and the Goodwife could aid
them as well as himself; Mistress Brewster, who,
with her family, had gone to the settlement, had
offered to shelter her, and he prayed her come.</p>

<p>Next morning Goodwife Rigdale bundled her
cloak about her, and set out in the shallop. Miles,
standing by the bulwark, watched her go, but only
for a time; it had snowed the night before, so the
railings were white and smooth to the touch, and he
found it of more absorbing interest to poke off
strips of the frozen snow, and send them splashing
into the cold-looking water beneath the ship's side.
By the time he looked again to the shallop, it was
so near shore he could no longer make out his
mother's figure, and his feet were chilled too, so he
went back to Dolly in the cabin.</p>

<p>At first he found it manly and grown up to be
left in charge, for so he esteemed his position. The
cut in his hand was healing well, and he felt he
would have been working ashore, if it were not that
some one must mind his father's quarters on shipboard
and care for Dolly and Solomon. He ordered
his sister about in a paternal manner; he
rebuked her severely if she so much as showed her
small, snub nose on the frosty deck without wrapping
herself up well; and he even insisted on her
going to bed punctually at sundown, while he, in
the glory of manhood, waited in the great cabin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
hear what news those who came from the shore
would bring.</p>

<p>But Dolly took her turn when it came to their
daily meals, for she had certain deft, housewifely
ways, which Miles could not hope to imitate, and
he was ashamed even of trying to better himself,
after he heard the little woman speak like her
mother of "men and boys that set a body's kitchen
in a mash." Miles might tug out the pot of broth,&mdash;'twas
all he was fit for; Goodwife Dolly would
herself do the stirring and tasting; and though,
among so many cooks, the broth sometimes burned,
yet they always contrived to eat it.</p>

<p>The four of them&mdash;Miles, Dolly, Jack, and
Solomon&mdash;ate their food together in the Rigdales'
cabin: most times it was only broth, or perhaps
salted meat and biscuit, which Goodwife Rigdale,
before she went away, had laid out for them; but
once Goodman Cooke brought them from the shore
a large piece of a cold roast goose. There was but
one drumstick, and each felt he should have it,&mdash;Jack
because he had been ill, and Dolly because she
was a girl, and Miles because he was the eldest.
Solomon said nothing, but he purred his loudest
and rubbed his head against Dolly's knee. They
ended by eating the drumstick together, each a bite,
turn and turn about, and what they could not get
from the bone was left to Solomon, who dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
his ration beneath the bunk, and, with eyes big and
fiery, growled at them.</p>

<p>The children remembered that supper, not only
because of the cold goose, but because it was the
last they ate together, for next morning Goodman
Cooke took Jack to the shore. Miles watched his
friend's small preparations enviously, and Dolly,
who had come also to stand in the doorway of the
Cookes' cabin, voiced a sorrowful wish: "I think
I'd best go too, and see father and mother."</p>

<p>"They've no place to put you, lass," Goodman
Cooke explained. "So soon as there is place,
they'll send for you both, be sure. For Doctor
Fuller says your father grows heartier, Miles," he
went on; "you've no need to worry yourself."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have not worried," Miles answered,
in some surprise.</p>

<p>After Jack went, life on shipboard was not so
pleasant. Dolly began to fret for her mother and
scoff at Miles's authority; Miles grew cross; and
the broth burned oftener than ever, and finally, giving
out altogether, left them with nothing to eat
but dry biscuit. With this woful tale of starvation,
Dolly betook herself at last to Constance Hopkins
in the great cabin, and Miles, glad that some one
should make known their unhappy state, yet
ashamed to do so himself, lagged on behind.</p>

<p>Constance Hopkins was Giles's sister, a slip of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
lass, not three years older than Miles, but to him
she seemed quite grown up. Certainly she bore
the responsibilities of age in those days, for not
only must she nurse her stepmother, Mistress Elizabeth
Hopkins, who lay helpless in her cabin, but she
must care for the baby, Oceanus, born on the voyage
across the sea, and the little half-sister, Damaris,
a baby also, not two years old. Yet somehow
motherly little Constance found time to comfort
Dolly, and cook a bit of meat for hungry Miles,
and assure them both that their father and mother
surely would come soon to look to them.</p>

<p>Dolly hugged the "big girl," but Miles could
scarcely do that, and he knew no civil speech to tell
his gratitude, so he was glad when, his eyes falling
on Damaris, he thought to pick her up. "I'll
mind her for you a bit, Constance," he offered.</p>

<p>Damaris was pleased with Miles's tousled hair
and sturdy arms, that held her more firmly than
her half-sister could; and Miles, never guessing
what a source of misfortune her liking would prove
to him hereafter, was much elated at his success
with her. He tugged baby out on deck to show
her the gulls looking for food in the water, and the
bright crusted snow that sparkled in the sunshine
on the wooded point. Damaris gurgled appreciatively
and pulled Miles's hair; then, when he
carried her back into the cabin, slept like a kitten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
whereat Constance was so relieved and pleased that
Miles gladly cared for the baby, his baby, the next
day, and the next.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/i_079.jpg" width="321" height="500" alt="two children looking at their mother in bed" />
<div class="caption">"Dolly plaited a fold of her apron between her fingers."</div>
</div>

<p>But the third day, a Friday, a pelting fine rain
set in that made an airing on the deck out of the
question, not for the baby alone, but for a well-grown
boy and girl. Miles and Dolly went up to
spend the afternoon in the great cabin, because in
their own quarters there was no one to talk to, and,
moreover, it was cold. In the main cabin they
would find some one to keep them company, and
they could, at least, warm their hands at the little
fire burning in a tubful of sand, which Constance
often used in heating food for Mistress Hopkins.</p>

<p>But this afternoon the fire was out and Constance
busied with her mother, so the two children, disappointed,
sat down together on a rude bench, at the
angle in the stern where two rows of little cabins
joined. "I wish I were with my mother," sniffed
Dolly; and "'Twill do you no good to cry," Miles
checked her sternly.</p>

<p>"I was not crying, Miles Rigdale," the damsel
answered hotly.</p>

<p>It was on Miles's lips to reply, when close at
hand a voice spoke his name, "Miles Rigdale!"</p>

<p>Readily enough he jumped up and went to the
half-opened door of the adjoining cabin. It was
Captain Standish's cabin, he remembered now, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
as he halted in the doorway, he perceived Mistress
Rose Standish lying in the bunk. A little of the
afternoon light sifted in through the tiny port-hole,
and by it he noted how her hair fell loosely about
her face, unlike the way she wore it when on deck;
but her cheeks were rosy as ever, and her voice
quite steady as she spoke: "It's you, the lad my
husband told me of? I thought I heard one
call you by name. Will you not do somewhat for
me, Miles? Fetch me my jug here full of water
again. Goodwife Tinker was to look to me to-day;
I felt very well this morning. But she's ill
now herself, and when I tried to rise,&mdash;" she laughed,
with a nervous catch in her laughter,&mdash;"why, then
things went whisking round me very strangely. But
you look as you still could stand stoutly, sir."</p>

<p>"I'll fetch you the water, and gladly, mistress,"
Miles answered, so eagerly that he stammered. He
stepped into the cabin to take the jug from where it
rested on a chest beneath the port-hole, and Dolly,
following shyly after, hesitated on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Is this little maid your sister?" Mistress Standish
roused up to ask. "Won't you come in and
bear me company, sweetheart, while Miles fetches
the water?"</p>

<p>Dolly plaited a fold of her apron between her
fingers and nodded dumbly.</p>

<p>"That's well," said Mistress Standish. "Sit you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
down here on the chest by me. And I've some
raisins of the sun you shall have if you'll stay."</p>

<p>"Dolly must not eat your raisins if you be sick."
Miles formulated the relentless principle which had
been enforced as regards himself when Dolly lay ill.
"And I'll fetch the water speedily." He stood a
moment on the threshold, balancing the jug in one
hand. "Mistress Standish," he blurted out, with
sudden resolution, "would you not rather have beer
than water?"</p>

<p>"Than the water from the ship's casks, yes," she
answered; "but 'twill relish well enough, Miles. At
even, when Captain Standish comes, mayhap he'll
get me a draught of beer."</p>

<p>"I'll get it for you now," Miles said cheerily,
and walked away, with his head up and the jug
swinging.</p>

<p>Outside the door of the great cabin the chilly
rain, that stung finely on his cheeks, pricked him
alive to realization of what he had undertaken.
Since Christmas, when the supply of the Pilgrim
emigrants had given out, beer could be obtained
on board the <i>Mayflower</i> only from the ship's stores,
through the courtesy of Master Jones, the captain;
and he was a terrible person. Most times he
ranged about the high quarter-deck, where only the
chiefs of the Pilgrims dared go; once Francis
Billington, to show his daring, had clambered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
thither, and Master Jones, without parley, had bidden
his quartermaster, "Kick that young imp down
into Limbo, where he belongs." From that experience
Francis had been black and blue, and subdued
in manner for a week.</p>

<p>So it was no wonder now that, for long minutes,
Miles stood shivering in the rain at the foot of the
companion ladder, while he tried to summon courage
to venture up. He might never have arrived
at such hardihood, had not Jones himself, strolling
forth upon the quarter-deck to study the weather,
observed him, and presently bellowed lustily: "What
beest thou staring up hither for, hey?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I want to come up, if it like you, sir,"
Miles piped quaveringly.</p>

<p>"Then come up. Beelzebub fetch thee! What's
hindering thee?"</p>

<p>Miles could have answered truly that it was a
loud-voiced, broad-shouldered man, with a bushy
gray beard, whose name was Jones, that hindered
him; but he thought best, even on so poor an invitation,
to scramble in silence up the steep ladder
to the quarter-deck. The wind there was high, so
he gripped the bulwark to keep erect.</p>

<p>"Well, now thou art up, what is it thou wouldst
have?" roared Jones.</p>

<p>"Beer, sir. For Captain Standish's wife. She
is ill."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Master Jones hesitated a little minute, then
caught Miles by the collar of his doublet, and only
let go when he landed him within the roundhouse.
Miles said nothing to this, but his heart thumped
alarmingly at finding himself thus tumbled headlong
into the very lair of the Master. Yet the
roundhouse proved a harmless place, with its shipshape
bunks and table and stools; and one of the
mates, who lay upon a bunk, rose up at Jones's
bidding, to do nothing more formidable than fill
Miles's jug from a keg that stood in one corner.</p>

<p>"Now see to it thou dost not filch the beer by
the way," grumbled Master Jones. "I be ready
to give to your Captain's wife, but not to fill the
stomach of every knavish lad on shipboard; dost
thou hear?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take the beer that was meant for
Mistress Standish," Miles said indignantly.</p>

<p>"Nay, but boys be a slippery race," growled the
Master. "The saints be blest I never had none!"</p>

<p>Miles privately was glad of that, for he could not
help thinking how unhappy a boy would be, with
such an alarming father as Master Jones. Very
prudently, he did not say so, but, seizing his jug,
backed out of the roundhouse, almost too hastily
to say "Thank you."</p>

<p>He had come back to a good conceit of himself,
however, by the time he had man&oelig;uvred safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
down the ticklish ladder, and he walked in on Mistress
Standish and Dolly quite proudly. Mistress
Standish thanked him mightily, enough to make
Miles redden and shuffle his foot on the floor.
"But I liked to do it for you," he muttered.</p>

<p>After that he was persuaded to sit down on the
chest beside Dolly, and tell Mistress Standish all
about how they were building houses on the shore,
and how he had gone to the Indian fields, and what
a wonderful dog Trug was. Dolly chimed in there
to tell what a rare pussy Solomon was, and how he
would leap over your hands. Then Mistress Standish,
who lay listening, and seemed to like their talk,
though she said little, bade Miles bring her a box
from a shelf against the wall, and in it, sure enough,
were a few big raisins and a small handful of currants.</p>

<p>The sight was too much for Miles's scruples,
and when she urged the children eat of them, he
yielded, weakly as eager little Dolly. "We'll
take two raisins each," he said, with an effort at
firmness, "and three currants." Then, with a sigh,
he shut the box up tight, and ate his own share very
slowly.</p>

<p>Dolly finished more speedily, and straightway
Mistress Standish urged her sing to them. "Dolly
told me while you were gone that she is wont to
sing to mother," she explained to Miles. "Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
I want her to sing to me. You shall have more
raisins if you will, Dolly, in spite of Brother Miles."</p>

<p>Dolly was bashful, and, for all it was now murky
twilight, so faces were not plain to see, insisted on
sitting on the other side of Miles, where she could
hide behind him. Then, at last, she sang. "Though
it is a worldly song," she protested.</p>

<p>"No matter. I am what your people call a
worldly woman," Mistress Standish answered.</p>

<p>So Dolly cuddled up to Miles and sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>"Skip and trip it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hey non nonny!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For the lark is in the clover,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the fields are green and bonny,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a dappled sky shows over.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sing hey nonny nonny!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Tis blithe world and gay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When spring comes bonny</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the winter packs away."</span><br /></div>

<p>There Dolly broke off, short and sudden, and
Miles, looking to the dusky doorway, saw a man's
sturdy figure blocking it.</p>

<p>"'Tis you come back, Miles?" Mistress Standish
spoke quickly. "Come you in and sit down. Your
namesake and his sister have been caring for me
bravely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," came the Captain's voice out of the
dark. "That is&mdash; You must be wearied now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sweetheart. Come, Miles, my soldier, I want to
speak with you."</p>

<p>Miles wondered why, as he stepped out from the
cabin, the Captain troubled to put one arm about
his shoulders; he was pleased at the caress, yet
awkward in receiving it. "I want you to go in
here," said Captain Standish, leading him to the
cabin that the Brewsters had occupied. "Constance
Hopkins is waiting within to tell you somewhat.
And you must remember, Miles, that you are to
bear you like a man."</p>

<p>Miles wrested round suddenly and faced the
Captain. There was a little dim lantern light in
this part of the great cabin, not enough for him
to read the other's face, but he could guess and
feel what was coming. "Has anything gone wrong
with my mother? Tell me; tell me, quick!" he
cried.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE GOING LANDWARD</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>GOODMAN RIGDALE had died that day
at noon; he had seemed sure of recovery,
but there came a sudden change, and, with
the ebbing of the tide, his life went out. So much
they made Miles understand, gently as they could.
Dolly cried with choked sobbings, and Constance
Hopkins, who had come out and taken the little
girl in her arms, cried too. But Miles, who sat
apart from the others, astride one of the benches,
did not cry,&mdash;just scowled before him in stupid
fashion, and half snarled, "Don't touch me," at
Goodwife Tinker and the other women who had
hastened up to sympathize.</div>

<p>He was aware of the people about him and the
lantern light; that was all. Something inside him
seemed benumbed, and he did not care to talk, or
cry, or do aught but sit still. He listened to
Dolly; she was wailing now, "I want my mother.
Oh, take me to my mother!" He wished she
would hush; it worried him.</p>

<p>Then he heard some one else speak: "Look
you, Captain; Will Trevor and I are fresh enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to do 't, and there's the small boat belongs to the
shallop. And Rigdale's goodwife will be wanting
her bairns to-night. If you give the word, Will
and I, we'll row them ashore."</p>

<p>Miles looked up and saw Ned Lister, his cap on
straight and his face earnest, speaking with the
Captain. He rose, and, a little unsteadily, pushed
the women aside, so he could clutch Ned's arm.
"I want to go ashore," he whispered chokedly.
"Take me now."</p>

<p>"You shall go," said Captain Standish. "I'll
bid them make ready the boat."</p>

<p>"You and the little wench get on your cloaks
briskly," Ned admonished, as he turned to follow
the Captain. "We'll be ready ere you be."</p>

<p>Constance came down with the two children to
the cabin beneath the main deck. It seemed darker
and colder than ever before, and Dolly's cloak
strings were tied in a hard knot, and Miles could
not find his mittens. At the very last, as, in stupid
fashion, he searched for them a third time in a bag
that held some odds and ends of his mother's, he
heard Dolly cry, "Oh, Solomon, poor Solomon!
Don't leave him behind, Miles. I know they'll
not tend him. And daddy was fond of him."</p>

<p>The cat was dozing among the blankets, but when
Miles, slow and uncomprehending, tried to seize
him, he took fright and ran beneath the bunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've the boat ready. Quickly, Miles!" called
Ned Lister in the passageway.</p>

<p>Miles saw Solomon's eyes shining yellow in the
dark beneath the bunk, and, making a grab, he
clutched the cat. The creature spit and clawed, but
Miles, with his hands bleeding, still clung to him,
and, headlong, thrust him into the bag that had held
their biscuit. One white paw came struggling out,
but the boy shoved it in roughly, and drew the
strings tight.</p>

<p>"Wait, wait! Your cloak, Miles." Constance
detained him, and fastened his cloak about his neck.
Miles suffered her, like a very little boy, and then,
slinging Solomon's bag over one shoulder, he followed
Dolly up on deck.</p>

<p>The rain, pelting on his cheeks and forehead,
half blinded him, and the faces of the men, seen fitfully
beneath the flaring light of the lantern at the
gangway, looked strange to him. Their voices had
no meaning, and they must repeat the question
when one asked: "What have you there, Miles?
Give me the bag; I'll hand it you."</p>

<p>Miles shook his head and pressed the bag tighter
beneath his arm; he could feel the cat's soft body
writhing and struggling within. They brought him
over to the gangway ladder, and, holding by one
hand, he scrambled down it. How black the line
of bulwarks looked against the lantern light, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
ship heaved upward! There he half slipped, when
he felt some one catch him round the body, and
he was dropped down on the stern seat of the little
boat. Dolly pressed close to him, and, putting his
arm round her, he held tight to her and to Solomon.
They had turned the lantern now so the light flashed
into the boat, and he realized it was Lister who sat
upon the forward thwart, and the other man, who
was standing up to push them off from the ship's
side, was the sailor, Will Trevor.</p>

<p>At last they were clear, out on the wide, rough
water, and, with a motion of spitting on his hands,
Trevor dropped into his seat and gripped his oar.
As the boat swung round, Miles had sight of the
black bulk of the <i>Mayflower</i>, with a lantern gleaming
on her high quarter-deck and another just receding
from her gangway. Then, as the boat headed
for the shore, he could see the ship only by turning
his head, and that was too great an effort to make.</p>

<p>The thole-pins creaked, and the water slapped
against the prow. The waves were running high,
and, as the little boat leaped them, she seemed to
throb through her frame. The oars and the sea that
wrestled together made the only sound, for the rain
that dropped steadily was a quiet rain, and the men
who rowed for the most part kept silent. Once, to
be sure, Trevor growled: "How're we heading,
Ned?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Miles noted dully how Lister rested on his oar
and turned his face landward. "I can just make
out a light," he answered. "Pest on this rain!
More to larboard we must run."</p>

<p>For another space they tugged at the oars in
silence, while Miles stared unheedingly into the
dark, till suddenly Trevor called, "Hey, lad, what's
wrong wi' thy bag?"</p>

<p>Solomon's struggles had loosed the fastenings,
Miles found; he thrust the animal back and tied the
strings again, slowly and stiffly, for his hands were
cold and sore too, where they had been scratched.</p>

<p>"What sort o' luggage be ye travelling with?"
Trevor asked, between strokes, in a tone that was
so amused that Miles felt an angry shock: what
right had the sailor to find any merriment in life,
while Dolly was sobbing so? Next moment the
anger passed, and instead, Miles wondered that
Dolly should cry, for it was not true, whatever they
had said; his father would surely come forth from
the Common House to meet them, and he would
look just as Miles had seen him on that last day.</p>

<p>Yonder beneath the black bluff shone a light.
Miles could see it now, and he stared unthinkingly,
till it grew larger and brighter, and then a sudden
jar almost threw him from his seat. "I'll hold her
steady," spoke Trevor. "Do thou get out the
younkers, Ned."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come, Miley, are you asleep?" said
Lister. Miles saw him kneeling on the rock close
beside him, holding the boat's gunwale with one
hand, and with the other outstretched. "Give me
the bag. Now then, steady. Ah! You did yourself
hurt?"</p>

<p>Miles picked himself up from the rock where he
had fallen; his knees were aching, and he suddenly
felt he should like to cry. "Yes, I hurt me," he
said dazedly. "Give me Solomon."</p>

<p>He made his way, groping through the dark, to
the path beneath the bluff that led up to the settlement.
The ground had thawed, so broad puddles
had formed; he must have splashed into one, for,
as he stepped, his shoes squeaked with water. Ned
Lister strode up alongside him, with Dolly gathered
in his arms. "You come with me up to the Elder's
house, Miley," he said breathlessly, for Ned was
wiry, rather than robust, and Dolly was a heavy little
maid.</p>

<p>All the way up the hill Miles had a sickening
sense of awaking to something full of dread. The
ground and the sky and the dimly seen houses were
now all real; he felt the rain and the cold and the
weight of the bag on his arm, and he began to realize
that what had happened also was no dream.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he cried, with a sudden hard gasp, and,
dropping the bag, broke into a run. He stumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and slipped, but pantingly he held on till he reached
the Brewsters' cottage. From one of the tiny windows
a light shone forth, but it blinded without aiding
him. He fumbled a moment at the heavy door,
then, grasping the rude latch at last, thrust it open
with his shoulder, and plunged headlong into the
common room.</p>

<p>On the hearth, opposite the door, a fire blazed,
and on the table flickered a candle. Spite of the
dazzle of sudden light, Miles made out a woman,
just turning from the fire, and, knowing her for the
Elder's wife, ran to her. "Where's my mother, my
mother?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, Miles! You must quiet yourself
ere you see her," Mistress Brewster urged, never so
gently.</p>

<p>But there came from an adjoining room his
mother's voice: "Miles, I am here. Come to me."</p>

<p>The narrow chamber was dark, but, seated in the
far corner, he could distinguish a woman's bowed
figure, and, stumbling heavily across the floor, he
flung himself on his knees beside her. "Mother!
Oh, mother!" he choked, and, burying his face in her
lap, burst out crying.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE MAN OF THE FAMILY</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AT first Miles found a jarring unfitness in
everyday life. Only eight and forty hours
before, they had buried his father on the
bluff overlooking the harbor; they had read no
prayers over the dead, as the ministers did in England,
and, lest the savages should spy and note how
few the colonists were becoming, they had levelled
the grave, like the many round about it. A raw
wind had blown from off the sea, so Goodwife Rigdale
shivered as she stood by the grave, and Miles's
hands were senseless with the cold.</div>

<p>Now it was over, and Goodman Rigdale dead and
buried, but life went on, just as usual. Goodwife
Rigdale helped Mistress Brewster prepare food, and
ate of it herself; and Love and Wrestling, sorry
though they had been for their playmates' sorrow,
frolicked gayly with Solomon, whom Ned Lister
had brought to the cottage, bag and all. By the
second day, though her eyes were still heavy with
crying, and her mouth tremulous, Dolly plucked up
spirit to join the boys. Even earlier, Miles had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
begun to fetch wood and water for Mistress Brewster,
lay the fire, and help where he could; if only
everything had stopped for a time, till he could
realize what had happened and master himself, he
felt he could bear it; but the petty acts of living
would go on.</p>

<p>In such a mood of wretchedness he trudged forth
on the third morning, up the path beyond the spring,
to fetch sticks from the edge of the wood where the
trees had been felled. He gathered the fagots,
and was trying to tie them strongly, as his father
tied the swamp grass that last day they worked together,
when he saw Francis Billington, also in
search of wood, drawing near.</p>

<p>"Why, Miles!" the newcomer greeted him,
in some surprise, for in these days Miles avoided
his old comrades. But now there was no avoiding
till the wood was tied up, so Francis came to him
and, a bit awed, tried clumsily to be sympathetic.
"I'll help you tie that wood, Miles."</p>

<p>"I c'n do 't alone."</p>

<p>"Look you, my daddy's going fowling to-day.
Mayhap he'll take us."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go," snapped Miles, with a
sick sort of anger that other boys still could talk of
their fathers.</p>

<p>"You might at least be civil to a body," Francis
said rather huffily. "What need to carry such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
face for it, Miles? You were mortal afeard of your
father while he lived. And now he can never flog
you no more."</p>

<p>Without warning, other than a small catching of
the breath, Miles sprang to his feet and struck the
speaker in the face. Francis, thoroughly surprised,
hit back, and, clenching, they pitched over among
the crackling sticks. Miles fell uppermost, and,
hardly realizing how or why, he was pommelling
Francis lustily, when a mighty hand heaved him
up by the scruff of the neck. "You must not
strike a man when he is already worsted," spoke
the voice of long-legged John Alden.</p>

<p>Miles stood biting his lips that twitched. "'A'
shall not say&mdash;" he began, and there his voice broke.
"Oh, I wish he could flog me again!"</p>

<p>Alden stared a moment, then, with sudden understanding,
swung round upon the whimpering Francis
and rated him mightily, while Miles, glad not to be
noticed, caught up his bundle of wood and stumbled
away toward the settlement.</p>

<p>Yet this was the last outward showing of the
boy's grief. Little by little, as the busy days came,
he found himself fitting into his new life, and at
length even taking a certain zest in it. For he
was now man of the family, and the cares he felt
called on to shoulder did not a little to distract him
from any sorry broodings. He must work with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
his full strength, wherever they sent him and whoever
bade him; he must keep flibbertigibbet Dolly
out of mischief; above all, he must run after his
mother, as she went about to nurse the many sick
of the settlement, and see to it that she did not catch
cold or come to any harm.</p>

<p>The greatest and most important labor, however,
he did in the earlier days of his loss, when he went
to fetch his father's goods from the <i>Mayflower</i>.
Others might have said the work was done by Ned
Lister, for Master Hopkins, who had promised
Goodman Rigdale to look to his family, so far as
he was able, sent him about this task; but Miles,
who was sure he was the leader and Ned only the
assistant, felt the whole expedition a tribute to his
own new-come manliness.</p>

<p>They went out in the shallop to the <i>Mayflower</i>
on a morning so bright and open that it scarcely
recalled to Miles his coming from the ship. Once
aboard, to be sure, the half-homesick pang laid
hold on him, when he scrambled down to the little
cabin that had sheltered him so long; but there
was so much to do he soon cast it off. The
bedding must be tied up securely, and the pots
and platters loaded into the biggest kettle; and
Ned, who had a coughing fit and said he didn't
feel very well, let Miles do it all. He recovered,
however, in time to help drag the stuff to the deck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and to get up from the orlop a small chest of
Goodman Rigdale's; and he was also selfish enough
to take charge himself of the loud, manly labor of
transferring the goods to the shallop.</p>

<p>Somewhat disappointed, Miles clambered down
again to the cabin to fetch the box with Dolly's
Indian basket, and, when he came back, the shallop
was so near ready to push off that he had only
time to drop into the bow beside Lister. Glancing
round the great sail toward the stern, where such
other passengers as were going from the ship were
placed, he caught sight of Captain Standish, who
sat stiffly, with one arm about the muffled figure
of a woman. "Yon is Mistress Standish, is it
not?" Miles questioned Lister, very softly.</p>

<p>His companion nodded. "Set to come ashore,
poor lass!" he answered, in the same low tone.
"'Tis the last trip she'll ever make in the shallop."
This Ned spoke sympathetically; then had no
further leisure to talk for settling himself comfortably
with his back against Goodman Rigdale's bedding.</p>

<p>Miles moved a little to give Ned room, but,
without heeding him, continued to gaze at Captain
Standish and Mistress Rose. He could not see
her face for the hood about her head and the cloak
drawn up above her chin, but he marked the listless
droop of her whole body; and he noted, too, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the Captain sat with his eyes looking straight out
and his mouth hard. Miles wondered if what
Lister said of Mistress Standish were true, and,
what with wondering and watching, was taken by
surprise and nearly overset when the shallop bumped
up to the landing place.</p>

<p>For a moment he lingered by the boat, feigning
to busy himself with unlading the kettle, while he
watched Mistress Standish. The Captain and
Alden, who was waiting at the landing, helped her
from the boat, and half carried her away between
them up the hill. The Captain's face was still so
grave and stern, that Miles was a trifle frightened,
and very sorry; he wished he were a man like
John Alden, so he could have spoken to the Captain
and helped Mistress Standish.</p>

<p>Then he had to think of other matters, for Ned,
with an access of energy, was tumbling the goods
ashore, and they must together drag them up to
the Elder's house. Just at present that was home
to Miles, because his mother and Dolly lived there,
and he sometimes ate with them, though, as an
additional mark of manhood,&mdash;so he esteemed it,&mdash;he
spent his nights at the Common House.</p>

<p>It really came about because his friends could not
shelter him. Goodwife Rigdale and Dolly had the
last spare bed at the Elder's house; the cottage
higher up the hill, on which Goodman Rigdale had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
labored, and where Goodman Cooke and Jack had
now one bunk, was filled with men whose houses
were building; while Master Hopkins, however
well he might mean by his friend's son, had not a
roof to cover his own family. So Miles slept with
Giles Hopkins at the Common House, where at
night the beds were placed so thick one need not
step on the floor in passing from the fire to his
sleeping place.</p>

<p>On Sunday all was changed, however, for then
the Common House became a meeting-house.
They tucked the beds up in corners, and swept the
floor, as Miles knew to his cost, for on this, his
second Saturday on the mainland, they pressed him
into the service. Twice on the Sabbath the Elder
taught his little company, and prayed with them
there,&mdash;a sorry little company indeed, of whom
fair half lay sick within the cheerless cabins, or dead
beneath the level ground of the harbor bluff.</p>

<p>The thought of his own dead father made Miles
listen attentively that day; and, when he walked
staidly up to the Elder's house before twilight, he
took Dolly apart into his mother's cold little chamber,
where he read to her from Goodman Rigdale's
black-letter Bible. He was a painful reader, but he
felt it was the fit thing for him to do in filling his
father's place, so, with the great book on his knees,
he sat on the floor, beneath the little window that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
let in the light sparsely through its oiled paper, and
Dolly sat by him, with her head on his shoulder.
He was much elated at finding her so quiet and attentive,
but, when he paused to recover breath at the
end of a very tough sentence about the Perizzites,
he perceived the little girl was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Miles did not wake her; just sat with the Bible
in his lap and his stiffening arm round his sister
till, when it had grown darker, his mother came to
seek them. He had nothing to say to his mother
that night, but afterward it was something to remember
keenly, though with an under-pang of
sorrow, how he had sat close by her in the dark
and had felt her hand rest on his head.</p>

<p>Next day was dreary with rain and sleet, and a
dull twilight that, closing in early, drove Miles into
the house, where he played at Even-and-Odd with
the little Brewsters and Dolly, very quietly, because
the Elder was writing at the table. Elder
Brewster was always kindly-spoken, but the fact
that he knew such a deal about the next world, and
what would befall you if you were not good, put
Miles in great awe of him.</p>

<p>When he went forth at length, Miles, feeling
more like himself, raised his voice, and even let the
trenchers clatter while he and Dolly laid the table.
But he had no desire to be noisy, when, late in the
evening, the Elder returned from the house where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the sick lay. A word or two passed between the
older folk that sent Miles with a whispered question
to his mother, who told him simply that Mistress
Rose Standish had died that evening.</p>

<p>Dolly cried, because she was a foolish girl, but it
did not stir Miles so deeply. Indeed, he did not
come to feel a hearty grief till next morning, when,
as he climbed the hill to Elder Brewster's cottage,
he saw Captain Standish, grim and set-faced, trudging
up to the woods through the sleet and rain.
The weather was too bitter for work, and the axe
which the Captain carried was, Miles guessed, a mere
pretext. All through the day it made him shiver to
think of the solitary man, lingering in the cold
among the pines; he wondered if even to himself
the Captain would make pretense of working, or if
he would sit idle among the wet logs.</p>

<p>But forty-eight hours later the Captain was going
and coming and working among the rest, just as
before, though maybe a bit more silent. For the
hale ones who could labor were few; the work must
be done; and, where so many were falling, there
was small space to grieve for a single life.</p>

<p>Miles had even grown somewhat blunted to the
sight of the sorry little companies that twice and
even thrice a week trudged with the body of a
friend or kinsman to the bluff above the harbor.
His own life went on methodically; he worked, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
even played with Jack Cooke and Trug, and some
days, when he was allowed to go fowling with Ned
Lister and Giles Hopkins, fairly enjoyed himself.</p>

<p>But Ned began presently to have coughing fits
even when he was bidden to go hunting, though
Miles, who had grown distrustful of his convenient
illness, urged him to "have done with fooling and
come along." One morning in February, when
Lister, instead of going about his work, was wasting
his time thus with Miles and Jack and Giles by the
fire in Goodman Cooke's cottage, came another to
urge him, no less a one than Master Hopkins.
Miles remembered a long time the terrible rating
he gave Ned for his laziness and trickery, and he
wondered that the young man sat with his head
leaning on his fist, and flung back but a single protest:
"I can judge better than you, sir, whether I be
ill or not. 'Tis my head that's aching, not yours."</p>

<p>To which Master Hopkins retorted grimly that,
if there were a whipping post in the colony, something
besides Ned's head would ache.</p>

<p>Then, for that there was no help for it, Lister took
his fowling piece and slouched away from the fire.
"I'm going, since you drive me," he said sulkily,
"but these youngsters need not follow at my heels.
'Twill be all I can do to fetch myself home again,
let alone three brats."</p>

<p>Much disappointed, Miles spent the day in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
less joyous labor of fetching and carrying on the
great hill, where they were putting the last touches
to the platform on which the guns were to be
mounted. He came to be interested, none the
less, when Goodman Cooke told him how, in a
few days, they would drag the guns up the hill and
put them in place. That would be a brave thing
to see, Miles thought, for the sailors from the
<i>Mayflower</i> were to come ashore and help, and the
street from the hill to the landing place would be
noisy and busy. Not so busy, though, as the crew
of the <i>Mayflower</i> would have made it a month
before, for the sickness now had settled on the
ship, where it was raging unchecked.</p>

<p>At dusk, as Miles came down from the hill, he
chanced on Master Hopkins, still grumbling at
Lister, who bade him go see if that malingerer
were loitering anywhere in the settlement. It
seemed a spying errand, but, not thinking of disobedience,
Miles started down the street. Nearest
the shore stood the Common House, the house for
the sick, and the storehouse, all three of which, to
make the search complete, he visited.</p>

<p>In the big main room of the sick-house lay the
men who were ill, and, as Miles stepped in, on
tiptoe because of his heavy shoes, the first thing he
saw beneath the candlelight was Ned Lister's black
head, half hidden under the coverlets of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
bunks. Miles stole up to him. "Why, Ned, ha'
you cheated the Doctor himself?" he whispered
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Lister raised his head and looked at him, with
his eyes very bright. "I'm cheating you all; yes,"
he said, with a laugh. "Go tell Hopkins be more
cautious next time how he wastes so good a property
as a serving man. A pity! If I die he'll be out
my passage-money. Well, I always owed him a
grudge for bringing me to this forsaken country,
and I'll even scores now."</p>

<p>The thought seemed to please Ned mightily, for
he laughed, till Doctor Fuller, stepping from the
inner room, sharply bade him hush. "Get you to
Master Hopkins and tell him the man is ill," he
ordered Miles; and, as he let the boy out at the
door, added, for his ear alone, "very ill."</p>

<p>Somehow Ned's overthrow frightened Miles more
than any other illness. Lister had always seemed
so tough and wiry that his succumbing at last set the
boy to asking himself, in some fright, if he, too,
might not fall ill. A soreness in his throat or an
ache in his head made him nervous. He questioned
Jack minutely as to how he felt before he
was taken sick, and then he began at once to feel
as Jack had felt. He started to tell his mother and
get her to comfort him, but then he was ashamed;
she was busy and anxious all the time for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
people she was called on to nurse, and he was a
great, strong boy, who, of course, would not be
sick.</p>

<p>But one day his head ached in good earnest&mdash;no
imagination; and next morning the ache was
worse, so he was too stupid even to go out.
Wrestling Brewster was ailing too, so Dolly and
Love stayed by his bed to amuse him, and Miles
was left quite alone. All day he sat toasting himself
by the fire, till he was too warm and was sure
his head ached because of the heat, so out he went,
and tramped up and down the street till his teeth
chattered with cold. He wanted no supper, but he
went back to the house to bid his mother good
night and get to bed early.</p>

<p>"Mother came home very weary and has lain
down within," Dolly said, so he went into the bedroom.
A cold light streamed in at the little window,
but the corners of the low room were dark and the
pallet was in shadow. His mother was stretched
upon it, with the cloak that had been his father's
wrapped round her, but at his step she raised her
head. "It's you, my lad?" she asked, and reached
out her hand.</p>

<p>"I came in to give you good night, mother," he
said, in his manliest tone, because it made him
proud to think he was hiding his illness from her.
"I'll mess at the Common House to-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>She put up her hand, and, drawing his head
down to her, kissed him. Her cheek felt hot as
it pressed against his, and even in the dim light he
noted that her face was flushed, but his head ached
so lamentably that he made nothing of it. "Why,
deary, you're not ill?" he heard her say.</p>

<p>"Indeed, no, mother. No more ill than you,"
he answered bravely, and, bidding her good night,
went softly out of the room.</p>

<p>The west was all a chill yellow, and a northerly
breeze was astir that set Miles shivering long before
he reached the Common House. There a fire was
alight that looked comforting, and, going up to it,
he snuggled down in a corner of the hearth. At
the table of boards laid on trestles some of the men
were eating their supper, but Miles was sick at the
mere thought of food. He sat staring and staring
into the heart of the flames, where he could see the
outlines of the farmhouse at home, and then he saw
nothing, but he faintly heard steps upon the floor,
and somebody caught him up.</p>

<p>"What are you falling on the fire in that fashion
for, eh?" one asked, and the man who held him&mdash;he
had a vague notion it was Alden&mdash;questioned,
"What's wrong, lad?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;h!" wailed Miles, "I think I'm dying."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>IN THE TIME OF THE SICKNESS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>TO be sure, Miles did not die, but for some
days he lay in the sick-house, too ill to
give much heed to what went on about
him, or take thought for anything save his own
misery. From a mass of hazy recollections one or
two moments of that time afterward came back
clearly.</div>

<p>One such memory was of a dim morning within
the cheerless room, when, through the familiar
patter, patter of rain on the oiled paper at the
windows, he heard a latch creak somewhere and
men tread cautiously. Turning weakly on his
pillow, Miles looked to the door that led to
the inner room, where the sick women lay, and
he saw Goodman Cooke and Edward Dotey come
forth, stepping carefully, and carrying on a stretcher
between them something that was muffled up and
motionless. He turned his face again to the wall,
and neither thought nor reasoned of what it meant,&mdash;just
listened to the lulling patter of the rain.</p>

<p>The other time of which he kept remembrance
was a crisp night, when the whiff of wind that blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in at the outer door, as it was opened, smelt fresh
and good, and Cooke, who came to tend the fire,
piled the logs high. Dozing and waking, Miles
watched through half-closed eyelids the crowded
pallets about him, and the shadows that flickered
up and down the rough walls. He must have slept
a moment, but he roused up suddenly to see in the
waning firelight Elder Brewster, who bent over him
with a cup of drink. Leaning against the arm that
supported him, Miles swallowed the draught obediently,
and then the Elder, with more care than he
usually had time to bestow on a single patient,
laid him down and drew the coverings round him.
"Poor little lad!" Miles heard him say, under his
breath. "God comfort you!"</p>

<p>Miles wondered a little, but, too stupid greatly
to heed what was said, soon dropped to sleep once
more.</p>

<p>The crisis of his sickness must have passed
on that night, for a day or two later he felt enough
like himself to swallow with some relish a dish
of broth. Ned Lister, packed out from the sick-house
while still convalescent, to make room for
others, fetched him the broth, and helped him eat,
with a choking great spoon that made the process
slow. Miles wondered whether Ned had grown
thin or his clothes had grown baggy; perhaps 'twas
a little of both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, on the idle wonderment, followed more
serious thought, and, speaking slowly and weakly,
he asked, as Lister settled him in his pallet again:
"Tell me, Ned, why has not my mother been here
to nurse me, as she did you and the others?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you been well enough looked to,
Miley?" questioned Ned, bending down to tie his
shoestrings.</p>

<p>"'Tis just the men have cared for me."</p>

<p>"Well, you're a man yourself, and want only men
to look to you, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not a man," said Miles, the ready tears
of sickness welling into his eyes, "and I want my
mother."</p>

<p>"I heard she had a touch of the fever herself,"
answered Ned, still busy with his shoes. "We're all
helpless with it, Miles. There's only seven of us now
that can crawl about to do aught. And the Captain
and the Elder are working each like three. By the
Lord, those be two good fellows!" This earnestly,
for Ned; and then, gathering up his bowl and spoon,
he walked away to minister to the next sick man.</p>

<p>Every one ill, and the care of the whole colony
on the shoulders of seven men, some half sick themselves!
Miles realized vaguely that he ought to be
patient and not fret at anything, but still the next
two days of his slow convalescence were long and
hard to bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>He was glad enough, one dim morning that
seemed like all the others, when the Elder came
into the sick-room with Dolly at his side. "The
little wench begged to come to you, Miles," he said,
as he seated her on the edge of the boy's pallet.
"But she is to talk only few words, and softly,
because there are others lying here very ill."</p>

<p>So soon as he had turned and left the children to
themselves, Dolly bent and dabbed a kiss upon her
brother's chin. "Though you make me shy, near
as if you were a stranger, Miles," she explained, in
a subdued whisper, "you are grown so peaked, and
your eyes are so very round."</p>

<p>Miles smiled weakly, but happily, it was so good
to see the face of one of his own people. "I'm
glad you came, Dolly," he said, drawing her hand
tremulously into his. "Mother will soon come
too, will she not? Why did she not come with
you?"</p>

<p>A choke made Dolly's whisper broken: "She&mdash;could
not."</p>

<p>"Is she ill?"</p>

<p>Dolly nodded, with a piteous face.</p>

<p>Miles's thin fingers gripped her hand fast. "Dolly,
she isn't&mdash;dead?" His voice rose high and frightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't, Miles," Dolly gasped. "And
I can't tell you. They said I must not speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
her to you. Oh, Miles, Miles, she has been dead
these four days!"</p>

<p>They carried Dolly away, the mischief done, and
Miles, hiding his head beneath the bedclothes, cried
so long as strength was in him. Then he lay watching
the red and orange streaks that flashed before
his tight-closed eyes, and, thinking how stuffy it was
beneath the coverlets, wondered if perhaps he would
not smother. He hoped he would, so he had a
first sensation of fretful disappointment, when some
one uncovered his head; and then, as he caught the
clearer air on his face and looked up at Captain
Standish, felt vaguely comforted.</p>

<p>"Drink you this, lad," spoke the Captain, gruffly,
yet, Miles realized, with vast pity in his tone.
"Then sleep."</p>

<p>"I'll&mdash;try," swallowed Miles.</p>

<p>"That's well. Bear it soldierly, as we all must."</p>

<p>"Like a soldier," Miles repeated over and over
to himself, and, shutting his lips, pressed his head
into the bolster, till, worn-out, he slept.</p>

<p>When he awoke, the realization of his loss returned,
keen almost as ever; but he was a healthy
lad, so inevitably strength came back to him, and
with it, little by little, as he mastered it in silence,
his grief abated. Those about him were kind, too,
and did what they could to comfort him. Captain
Standish himself cared for him; Ned Lister and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Giles visited him often; and once they even let
poor, guilty Dolly come to see him. She fetched
in her arms fat Solomon, who yowled so piteously
that, just inside the door, Doctor Fuller, who was
up and able to tend his sick again, made her put
him down, whereupon the cat fled home, fast as
four legs could bear him.</p>

<p>"'Twas such a pity when I fetched him so far to
see you," Dolly lamented to Miles, as she exhibited
the scratches on her hands, "but he will go
home safe to Mistress Brewster's house. He likes
it there, and so do I. I am going to live there
always with Love and Wrestling and Priscilla Mullins.
She made me a poppet of a piece of scarlet
cloth, and I called it after her. I shall bring it to
show you next time, though you'll laugh at it,
because you are a boy. Indeed, I do like it at
Mistress Brewster's. If only mammy and daddy
were there too!" she added, in a lower tone.</p>

<p>Elder Brewster himself had, at the very first,
paused by Miles's bed, and spoken gravely to him
of how his mother was now in a more blessed place,
and he must try always to be a good boy, so some
day he might join her. Though he listened dutifully,
Miles did not care for the Elder's admonitions
as much as he cared for Mistress Brewster's
words. Newly risen from her sick-bed, she came to
him, and, sitting by his pallet, whispered him of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
mother, and how, before she died, she had left her
love for him, and bidden him always be a good lad
and a good brother to the little wench. "Though
my lad will be that without my bidding," Alice
Rigdale had added. "He has always been a good
little son to me."</p>

<p>Miles listened, with his face held stolid; it was
only when Mistress Brewster bent and kissed him,
like his mother, that he blinked fast and turned
away his head.</p>

<p>Day by day he grew stronger, till he sat up in
bed, and then, by slow stages, was suffered to put
on his clothes and walk staggeringly across the
room. The next advance was his going out into
the air, which would doubtless have been longer
deferred if any one had had time to give close heed
to the sick boy. But Doctor Fuller was busied elsewhere,
and the Elder was looking to others of the
sick folk, so, one morning when Lister had helped
Miles into his clothes, the boy took matters into
his own hands by slipping out at the door.</p>

<p>It was a rare, mild March day, with a tender wind
of the spring that came from the western woods.
The earth was soft beneath the foot; the few bushes
that clambered up the bluff across the way were
bursting with brown buds; and the blue harbor
dazzled under the vivid sunlight. Leaning against
the doorpost, Miles joyfully drank in the freshness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of the morning, though his eyes grew wistful
as he looked again to the bluff yonder where were
the levelled graves.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="325" height="500" alt="man washing talking to another man" />
<div class="caption">"'Do you like to do it, Captain Standish?'"</div>
</div>

<p>Presently he summoned up his strength, and,
stepping cautiously off the doorstone, picked his
way round to the east side of the house, where the
sun was warmest. Here the ground was trodden
and bare, save for the chips scattered about the logs,
of which there was a great heap stacked against the
house-wall. At the other side of the pile, a tub of
water rested on a great block, and, most marvellous
of all, over the tub, busily washing a mass of bed-linen,
bent Captain Standish.</p>

<p>Miles caught his breath in a gasp of surprise that
made the Captain look up. "So you're well recovered,
Miles?" he asked cheerily.</p>

<p>The boy nodded, and set himself down on the
woodpile.</p>

<p>"Cast on my doublet, there beside you, if you
will be sitting here," said Standish, and, shaking
the water off his hands, came and wrapped the
garment about Miles.</p>

<p>Snuggling down against the sunny logs, Miles
gravely watched the Captain. He washed the
clothes deliberately, with a good deal of sober
splashing and a lavish use of soap; and then he
wrung them so vigorously that the muscles of his
bared arms stood out. So earnest and busy did he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
seem about the undignified task that, before he
thought, Miles blurted out: "Do you like to do it,
Captain Standish?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," the Captain answered cheerfully,
as he twisted a sheet so hard that a jet of
water spurted over the front of his shirt, "not in
the least, Miles. But there's no one else to do it,
and it must needs be done."</p>

<p>Miles pondered a moment. "I take it, that's
how it is with living; somebody has to," he said
at length.</p>

<p>"And somebody is right glad to," Captain Standish
answered, with a quick glance at Miles. "You
must get well and run about and do a man's share
of the work that's before us, and you'll soon be rid
of any heavy thoughts."</p>

<p>Miles sat still in the sunlight, and, reflecting
vaguely, called to mind that, if his father and
mother both were dead, Mistress Rose Standish,
who was all the Captain had, likewise rested yonder
on the bluff. Out of the fullness of knowledge the
Captain was trying once more to teach him how to
bear all bravely, he guessed, so he began stoutly:
"Yes, I'm going to be a man, sir. Because now I'll
have to take care of Trug and Dolly and Solomon."</p>

<p>Captain Standish smiled a little, as he gathered
the wet clothes into his arms. "You're a true man
already, Miles," he said. "At least, you're a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in the way you group your women-folk with your
cattle."</p>

<p>After the Captain had gone behind the house to
hang out his wash, Miles rested a time very thoughtful.
The sunlight was warm and pleasant, and southward
across the harbor the great bluff was dense with
evergreen. A brave world, and he was going to do
a brave part in it, as his mother had looked for him
to do.</p>

<p>A step upon the chips made him rouse up just as
Master Hopkins came leisurely round the woodpile.
His face was pale, for he, too, had been
touched with the sickness, and his manner was
kinder than Miles had ever known in him. "So
you're hale again, Miles Rigdale? Do you think
you could make shift to walk up the hill to my
house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Miles replied promptly. The house
that Master Hopkins was building when Miles fell
sick stood just across the street from the Elder's,
and the boy had made up his mind to drag himself
to the latter's cottage that day. It made his heart
quicken to think of seeing again the rooms where
his mother had lived that last month, and of talking
with Dolly and Mistress Brewster. He hoped, too,
that if he got up to the house they would keep him
there to supper, perhaps all night. So he answered
Master Hopkins's question confidently and happily:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
"Yes, sir. I can surely walk that far up the
hill."</p>

<p>"That's well," said Master Hopkins; "you shall
eat dinner with us this noontime."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," Miles answered, not overjoyed,
but civilly.</p>

<p>"I'll take you to the house with me when I go
back thither," the other pursued. "You understand,
you are to dwell with me hereafter."</p>

<p>When Captain Standish returned from his drying
ground, Stephen Hopkins had gone on down to the
landing, and against the logs huddled a piteous-faced
small boy, who at sight of him cried: "Captain
Standish, Master Hopkins says I must live
with him."</p>

<p>"Do you not wish to?" asked Standish, nonchalantly,
and, tipping the water out of his tub, set
himself down on the block where it had rested.</p>

<p>"I'd rather go anywhere else in Plymouth, unless
'twas to Goodwife Billington. Must I go to him,
Captain Standish?" Forgetting his usual respectful
demeanor, Miles rose, and, stumbling the few steps
to the Captain, leaned against his knee. "I thought&mdash;maybe
I should go with Dolly to Mistress Brewster,"
he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Standish suddenly put one arm about him. "A
pity it couldn't be so, Miles! But the Elder's
house is full, and at Master Hopkins's there's half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a bed; you can sleep with Giles. In any case,
Master Hopkins was your father's kinsman."</p>

<p>"I could go to Goodman Cooke," pleaded Miles.
"Or&mdash;or&mdash;I wish I could live with you."</p>

<p>Standish laughed outright, though when he spoke
his voice was gentle: "I would take you, laddie,
and be glad to, if things were&mdash;as I thought they
would be. Rose had a liking for you." He
stopped short, and Miles, looking up in some awe,
noted that his eyes were fixed on the blue harbor,
yet he seemed to see nothing of it. When he spoke
again, his tone was quick and altered: "But as things
have fallen out, John Alden and I are sleeping in an
unfinished cabin and eating where we can find a bite.
And a little young fellow like you would be better
off in a household where there are women than with
two clumsy men. So they have arranged it all for
your best good."</p>

<p>Miles nodded, not trusting his voice to speak.
He was thinking of what the Captain had said about
being a man and things that had to be done, and he
meant to make a good showing before him. "I
like Giles," he began slowly, "and I like Constance,
and Ned Lister will be there too; I'll try
to like Master Hopkins&mdash;if he'll let me bring
Trug."</p>

<p>So he had put on quite a brave face by the
time Master Hopkins came to fetch him to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
new home. To him it was all so much a matter of
course that he offered no explanations or commonplace
cheering words to Miles; just bade him come,
and soberly led the way up the hill. Miles, with
his feet like lead and his brave resolution flagging,
loitered half-heartedly behind him, till Master Hopkins
turned. "You're not yet as strong as you
thought, Miles Rigdale?" he said gravely, but
kindly enough, and, lifting the boy in his arms,
carried him up the hill.</p>

<p>Miles rested passive, one arm thrown perfunctorily
about Master Hopkins's neck, and wished he were
anywhere else.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>MASTER HOPKINS'S GUEST</small></h2>


<div class='poem'>
"'In Wakefield there lives a jolly pinder,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In Wakefield all on a green,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In Wakefield all on a green,&mdash;'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>THERE, there, Damaris! Hushaby, hushaby! Go
to sleep, like a good lass."</div>

<p>Damaris gurgled at Miles with a provokingly
wide-awake crow. "I never saw such a bad baby,"
sighed the little boy. "Do go to sleep, honey.</p>

<div class='center'>'In Wakefield there lives a jolly pinder,&mdash;'"<br /></div>

<p>"Oh, Miles," laughed Constance Hopkins, who,
standing at the rude table, was scouring the biggest
kettle, "you have sung that half a score of times.
Is there no other song you know?"</p>

<p>"It is no time for the child to sleep now," interrupted
Mistress Hopkins. "I'll wrap her up, and,
since 'tis so mild a morning, you may take her forth
into the air."</p>

<p>"O dear!" thought Miles, "I'm a man, not a
nurse." He never considered that it was any kindness
on his new guardians' part when, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
putting him to heavy outdoor tasks, they set him
to minding the baby and helping about the house.
"Like a girl," Miles told himself, with an indignant
sniff. It was not two weeks since he left the sick-house,
and his legs were still a little uncertain, but
he was sure he was fit to work again, or, at any rate,
fit to run away and play with the other boys.</p>

<p>But he took the baby now and walked forth
meekly, because he lived in some dread of Mistress
Elizabeth Hopkins. She was a thin-lipped, energetic
young woman, who mended Miles's clothes
scrupulously, and, with equal conscientiousness,
boxed his ears whenever he tracked dirt on her
clean floors. Her sharp tongue, though, he feared
more than her hands, for Mistress Hopkins scolded
at everything and everybody; indeed, the only
members of the household whom her words never
troubled were Oceanus, who was so young he just
blinked his eyes when she talked, and Master Hopkins,
on whom people's fretting had as much effect
as it would have had upon the great rock at the
landing place.</p>

<p>After all, Miles was rather glad to get out into the
air, away from the living room, where Mistress Hopkins
was already chiding Constance. The morning
was fair and warm, with no wind stirring, and the
harbor sparkled invitingly, so, shouldering the unwelcome
Damaris, he started happily to the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>But his contentment speedily had an end, for, not
halfway to the landing, he was overtaken by Francis
Billington, Jack Cooke, and Joe Rogers, who at
once addressed him in disrespectful wise. "Ho,
Miles, that's brave work, tending a baby," jeered
Francis.</p>

<p>"You meddle with your own matters," Miles
replied sulkily.</p>

<p>"Come with us, Miles," Jack put in pacifically.
"We're going along shore to the first brook&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We do not want a baby with us," Joe interrupted.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> might stay with me, Jack," Miles pleaded,
as the others turned away.</p>

<p>Jack, a freckled little fellow with merry eyes,
dug the heel of his shoe into the dirt. "The other
lads will be having sport," he said half-heartedly.</p>

<p>"Then go with them," cried Miles. "Only
you were very fain to play with me on shipboard."</p>

<p>Even this last thrust failed; Jack ran after the
others down the hill, and Miles, feeling cross and
ill-treated, was left to himself.</p>

<p>'Twould look too much as if he were following
his ungracious friends if he went on to the landing,
so he turned back to Elder Brewster's house. There
Priscilla Mullins, a girl orphaned by the winter's sickness,
who, because she was eighteen, was classed by
Miles as a woman, was sweeping the doorstone with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a broom of birch twigs. She paused in the labor
teasingly to throw him a kiss, and tell him his busy
sister and the lads were cooking by the brookside.</p>

<p>Sure enough, in the level space between the base
of the bluff on which the cottage stood and the
cove, Miles found Dolly, and Dolly's poppet Priscilla,
and Love, and Wrestling, and Solomon, and
Trug, who was not admitted to Mistress Hopkins's
house because his great paws dirtied her floor,&mdash;all
busied in making delectable pies of mud.</p>

<p>But when Miles joined them, Love withdrew from
the mud-pie game, and wished to play at holding a
council, such as his father and all the men were
holding that morning in the Common House to
regulate the military affairs of the colony. Dolly
insisted that she should be allowed to come to the
council too, for all Love urged that women never
were invited thither, and the argument was growing
bitter, when an unwonted tumult in the village street
drew Miles's attention. A confused sort of calling
and shrill shouting it seemed, that made his heart
quicken between curiosity and alarm; so, snatching
up Damaris, he scaled the bluff, while the rest of
the children scrambled close behind him.</p>

<p>On the doorstone Mistress Brewster and Priscilla
were gazing in silent wonder toward the street, and,
looking thither too, Miles saw a man stalk past to
the landing, very deliberately, as if he knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
place and held he had the right to come there. It
was no one of the settlers, though, but a great,
half-naked fellow with a coppery face&mdash;an Indian.</p>

<p>Dolly and Wrestling clutched Mistress Brewster's
skirts, the little boy fairly crying, and Miles himself,
it must be owned, held Damaris fast and drew a step
nearer the doorstone. But next moment he noted
the Indian carried for weapons only a bow and two
arrows, with which he could not kill all the settlement,
and, moreover, at his heels tagged venturously
Giles Hopkins and several of the other boys,
and even Goodwife Billington, very clamorous, and
the Governor's serving maid.</p>

<p>So Miles, not to be outdone by a petticoat, swaggered
into the roadway and joined himself to the
little group of curious folk, who, always ready to
flee if he should turn on them, followed close at
the savage's heels, down the steep hill, past Peter
Browne's cottage, even to the door of the Common
House.</p>

<p>The noise in the street had already disturbed the
men at their conference, and they came flocking
forth at the door, the Governor, the Elder, and the
Captain, with a score of other stout fighters crowding
behind them. But the Indian, never a whit
abashed, strode boldly up to them, would even have
pressed into the house, had not their ranks barred
his passage. Nothing chilled, he halted, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
stretching forth his hands, spoke in a guttural
tone: "Welcome."</p>

<p>"Do Indians talk English?" Miles whispered to
Giles, who stood beside him. "Hush, hush, Damaris!
The black man won't hurt you."</p>

<p>But Damaris, quite unconvinced, clutched Miles
tightly round the neck and went on crying lustily,
till at last Goodwife Billington seized him by the
collar. "Thou good-for-naught lad!" she scolded.
"Wilt thou kill the poor babe? Take her back to
the house, thou runagate! Ay, ay, let her scream
herself ill, so thou mayest gape and gaze. I would
I had the up-bringing of thee!"</p>

<p>Some people besides himself liked to gape
and gaze, Miles thought, but, without reply, he
gathered the wailing Damaris into his arms and
trudged slowly up the hill. There, by the Governor's
house, it chanced he met with Francis and
Jack and Joe, who, scenting something unusual in
the village, had hastened back through the fields.
"What is it has happened, Miles?" cried Joe.</p>

<p>Miles, glancing over his shoulder, saw with unkind
satisfaction that the men had taken the savage
into the Common House, out of sight. "'Twas
naught," he said airily. "Just a great Indian came
into town."</p>

<p>"Did you see him?" urged Francis. "Tell us
about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph! You've no wish to talk to me when
I'm tending a baby," sniffed Miles, and trudged on
to Master Hopkins's house, so elate at his triumph
that he forgot to be angry with Damaris for dragging
him away from the sport.</p>

<p>At the noon meal, indeed, he heard all and more
than he could have learned, had he lingered about
the door of the Common House, for Ned Lister
was bubbling over with talk of the Indian. As
Master Hopkins had stayed at the Common House
and Dotey had none of his fellow-servant's faculty
for gathering news, he proved the only tale-monger
of the household; so the whole family harked to him
respectfully, and even Mistress Hopkins forgot her
usual sarcasms on his galloping tongue.</p>

<p>"This is not a savage from these parts," Ned explained;
"he comes from the eastward, from Monhegan,
whither the ships out of England go to fish.
He has been on shipboard there and so has got a
smattering of the English tongue. One Captain
Dermer brought him to Cape Cod, and he has been
in these parts now some eight months. And he
told us a deal of the nations hereabout. This open
place where we have settled is called Patuxet. It
was a village of the savages once, but three or four
years back came a great plague, and all the people
died, so now we are undisputed masters of the soil.
Next unto us dwell the Massasoits, a tribe of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sixty fighting men; and to the southeast, those
savages whom our men gave a brush to on their
explorations in December, are the Nausets, near a
hundred strong."</p>

<p>Ned paused to secure himself another slice of
cold mallard; then started on a new train: "You
should 'a' seen the Indian fellow eat. He asked
for beer, but we gave him strong water, and biscuit
and butter and cheese and pudding, and a piece of
mallard thereto, and he liked all very well, and ate
right heartily."</p>

<p>"He is not the only idler who looks for a full
meal," said Mistress Hopkins scathingly. "Where
have they put the vile creature now?"</p>

<p>"Vile creature, mistress?" Ned repeated. "Sure,
he says that in his own country he is a great lord of
land, a Sagamore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would he were back in his own country,"
Mistress Hopkins answered sharply. "The murderous
wretch! I shall not draw a breath in peace
till he be hence. Here, Ned, 'tis little enough work
you'll do if you go forth, do you stay this afternoon
in the house to protect us."</p>

<p>There was an instant of disappointed silence on
Lister's part, then, "'Tis you she means, Ned
Dotey," he cried, and, without staying to take his
cap, bolted out at the door.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only desertion which Mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Hopkins suffered; for, at their first opportunity,
Dotey and Giles also slipped away, and Miles
stayed behind only because he was so little that the
mistress shook him when he attempted to follow.
But speedily he had a bright thought, and asked
Mistress Hopkins if perhaps, since she was afraid
of the Indian, she would not like him to fetch Trug
to the house to guard them.</p>

<p>Thus Miles was allowed, at last, to bring his dog
home, and so grateful was he, that he remained
patiently tending Damaris all the long afternoon.
He found a certain enjoyment in his position, however;
he was sole man in the cottage, and he wondered,
should other Indians follow this first one, if
Mistress Hopkins wouldn't let him take one of the
muskets and fight for her. When it came dark at
last, he knowingly inspected the fastenings of the
door, and told Constance not to be afraid; he and
Trug could defend them.</p>

<p>Poor Constance needed more comfort than that,
for she was in a sorry fright. Her hands shook as
she laid the table, and, when a step sounded crisply
in the dooryard, she gave a nervous cry and dropped
the pile of trenchers. It was only Ned Lister,
however, who stamped in, bareheaded and whistling
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"You have come back, then, since 'tis suppertime?"
Mistress Hopkins greeted him sarcastically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, I'm not hungry," Ned answered, as he
sauntered over to the fire where Miles sat with
Damaris, "'tis that the master sent me ahead to
bid you make ready the guest chamber and the bed
of state. Our Indian lord there, the Sagamore
Samoset, is to lodge here to-night."</p>

<p>For a moment Mistress Hopkins looked at the
speaker in dumb amazement. "If Master Hopkins
does not punish you roundly for such a lie,
Edward Lister," she said at last, deliberately, "it
will not be for want of my urging him."</p>

<p>"It's the truth, though," Ned answered indifferently.</p>

<p>"O me!" Constance cried, with a sudden nervous
wail, "I know we'll all be slain ere daybreak.
O dear!" She turned to run into the bedroom,
when Lister caught her by the arm. "Don't cry,
Constance," he urged; "there's no need to fear.
Captain Standish and some of the others are coming
hither to spend the night and keep watch.
You'll be safe enough."</p>

<p>But the girl, breaking from him, vanished into
the chamber, whither Mistress Hopkins, snatching
up Damaris, followed her; so, for some moments,
Miles was free to ask questions and Ned to answer,
as it liked them best. But, so soon as Master
Hopkins's deliberate step sounded on the doorstone,
Mistress Hopkins came forth and, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
entered the living room, confronted him: "Is that
savage to be lodged here to-night, Stephen? Among
us, where my children are?"</p>

<p>"He must go somewhere, Elizabeth," the master
of the house replied unruffled. "He is set to stay
among us for the night, and the tide is out so we
may not convey him on shipboard. We can lodge
him in the little closet next our chamber."</p>

<p>"He shall not come into the house!" said Mistress
Hopkins, with her thin lips set.</p>

<p>"Edward Lister, do you spread out the bed
within the closet," Master Hopkins went on unheedingly.</p>

<p>With a wink at Miles, Ned crossed the room in
unusual haste, and Miles, taking a candle, followed
after into the closet, a tiny room with one black
window, where stood an old chest and a hogshead
and a rolled-up mattress, which Ned began leisurely
to spread out. "What think you, Miles?" he
whispered, as the boy closed the door behind him.
"It's good there is one person in the house whom
the dame cannot rattle off as she list, eh?"</p>

<p>Miles nodded vaguely, his attention all fixed on
the least details of the commonplace room which
now had a fearful interest from the guest it was to
shelter. The thought of the savage stranger filled
the place with such awesome fancies that he could
not help going out from it very hastily ahead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Lister, who grumbled a little that Miles was so
speedy to be off with the candle.</p>

<p>Once in the bright living room, however, he became
very brave indeed, and wondered to Giles
Hopkins when the Sagamore Samoset would come.
His mood grew the bolder when the elder lad
showed him a dirk knife he had placed under his
doublet. "For there's no being sure with these
treacherous savages," Giles said seriously.</p>

<p>But when the Sagamore came at last, the boys
found that the Hopkins household would be well
guarded, for with him were not only Master Hopkins
and Dotey, but big John Alden and Captain
Standish. The very sight of the latter reassured
Miles, so down he sat on the floor by the hearth,
with his arm round Trug, who, as soon as he spied
the Indian, bristled the hair on his back and uttered
a throaty growl.</p>

<p>Mistress Hopkins and Constance and the two
babies kept within the south chamber; but the
men by themselves were enough to fill the living
room. There were but two stools, besides the form
on the hearth and a chest against the wall, so long-legged
Giles must curl himself up on the floor by
Miles, while Ned Lister set himself upon the table.
They bade the Indian be seated on the form by the
fire, right over against Miles, who, be sure, stared
at him with eyes wide open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sagamore Samoset, he saw, was a tall, straight
man, of complexion like an English gypsy, smooth-faced,
with coarse black hair that fell to his shoulders
behind, but was cut before. Since his coming into
the settlement, his English hosts had put upon him
a horseman's coat, which he wore with much pride
and dignity; indeed, all his gestures and carriage
were not only decent, but of a certain stateliness.
"Why, he is somewhat like other men," Miles
whispered softly to Giles, but Trug grumbled in
his throat.</p>

<p>Only one candle was burning in the room, but
the firelight cast a flickering brightness on the faces
of the men. Captain Standish and Lister and the
Indian had lighted pipes of tobacco, and the air
was so heavy with the smell of the smoke that
Miles half drowsed, but through his drooping eyelids
he watched his English comrades, and watched
the Indian. Captain Standish was sitting adventurously
right on the form beside the Sagamore, and
now and again they spoke together. Miles noted
that in the Indian's speech came strange words,
which the Captain seemed to try to understand, and
once or twice the Captain even sought to make use
of them himself.</p>

<p>Miles wondered at this, and then his only wonderment
was as to whether he had been asleep.
The logs on the hearth had broken into red embers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the men had risen up; and, rubbing the heaviness
from his eyes, Miles saw Master Hopkins and the
Captain usher their Indian guest into the little closet
room.</p>

<p>Straightway a certain tension in the company
seemed to slacken; Giles rose stiffly from the floor,
and Trug put down his head upon his paws, though
he still kept one bright, half-opened eye fixed on the
door through which the Indian had gone. With a
great creaking of the trestles, Ned Lister dismounted
from the table. "If he come to kill us,"
he said in a low tone to Alden, "do you run in and
call me so I can have a share in the scuffle." Then,
stretching himself mightily, he disappeared into the
north bedroom, where the serving men and the boys
of the household slept.</p>

<p>"Since you have two others to keep watch with
you, Master Hopkins," spoke the Captain, as he
took down his hat from the wall, "I'll go walk a
turn about the hill. I'll be back ere the half-hour
is up."</p>

<p>He had put his hand to the latch, when Miles, on
the impulse, sprang to his feet and ran to him.
"May I come too, sir?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"You, Miles? Why, you were better in bed.
Nay, come if you like."</p>

<p>Out of doors the air was crispy and silent, and
pleasant smelling after the smoky atmosphere of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
crowded room. Overhead the stars were dense and
bright, but below, the lonely little settlement lay in
darkness, with never a spark of a candle showing.
"How late is it, Captain Standish?" Miles asked,
in a hushed voice.</p>

<p>"I should say it was near on to midnight," the
other replied, stepping along so briskly that Miles's
breath for talking was lost in the effort to keep pace
with him.</p>

<p>Up and up they toiled; past Goodman Billington's
cottage; past the black cabin where Alden
and the Captain lived; and then by the well-trodden
path up the sheer hillside, till the planking of the
broad platform sounded hollow beneath their feet,
and they stood among the guns. The spark in the
Captain's pipe gleamed red in the darkness, but
Miles could not see the Captain's features; he perceived
only that he turned his face from quarter to
quarter, and remained longest gazing into the black
west, where the ridge of hills ran jagged against the
starry sky.</p>

<p>He watched the Captain's movements, but he did
not venture to speak till Standish himself broke
out: "Well, there'll come no bands to frighten us
this night, I take it. We can march home, Miles.
We've a fair starlight to make the march under," he
added, and, as they stepped from the platform to the
yielding turf, lingered an instant to gaze skyward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which is it that is the North Star, sir?" Miles
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Why, that one yonder, lad. You know it
well."</p>

<p>"I knew 'twas the North Star in England. I
knew not if 'twere the same here. It is such a long
ways from home."</p>

<p>"It's the same sky, Miles, and the same Heaven,
I take it, that we had over us in England."</p>

<p>Miles threw back his head and once more stared
up into the sky, that was so vast it made him shrink
and feel smaller even than before. He sighed a
little, he scarcely knew why, and put his hand on
the Captain's sleeve. Standish took Miles's hand
in his, and so kept hold on him as they came
down from the hill, and in that pressure was something
so comforting that Miles was sorry when they
reached the door of Master Hopkins's house.</p>

<p>Within was heavy air, and a dull fire, and sleepy
faces; Giles had gone to lie down on his bed, and
it did not need the Captain's bidding to send Miles
blinking after. Once, in the darkness, he was
wakened by hearing Lister protest inarticulately
that he would rather have his throat cut in his
sleep ten times over than rise and watch; and once
Miles guessed hazily that some one was shaking
him, and he tried to say he was getting up, and in
the midst dropped back on his pillow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>At the last the dazzle of warm sunlight on his
face, and the rattle, rattle of trenchers, brought him
staggering and blinking to his feet. Oh, yes, he
remembered; the Sagamore Samoset had been there
last night; but he was not afraid of him, especially
since 'twas daylight; indeed, he wanted to see him
again, so out he rushed into the living room.</p>

<p>"Well, sleepyhead!" Constance laughed at him,
and Mistress Hopkins was beginning to scold him
because he had not awakened, for all her efforts, till
mid-morning, when Ned Lister sauntered in. "His
Lordship the Indian is safe departed, Constance," he
said consolingly, as he made a slow business of
getting an axe from the chimney corner. "They
gave him a knife and a bracelet and a ring, and he
is gone away content."</p>

<p>"A good riddance, too!" snapped Mistress
Hopkins. "And now do you, Edward Lister,
fetch two buckets of water and wash out the place
where the creature lodged. To bring such heathen
under a Christian roof! I hope I never set eyes
on another of the coppery wretches again."</p>

<p>Ned shrugged his shoulders and said nothing till
his mistress was quite done; then he added meekly:
"I misremembered; he said he was coming back
again in a night or two, and next time he is going
to bring with him a goodly number from the tribe
of the Massasoits."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE LORDS OF THE SOIL</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>SAMOSET proved as good as his word. The
very next morning, for all it was Sunday,
back he came, and with him five other tall
Indians, who were even more wonderful fellows than
he, for they were clad in skins of deer or of wildcat,
and had dressed their hair with feathers, and
painted their faces in black streaks. To divert
their English hosts, they sang and danced, which
Master Hopkins called a violation of the sanctity of
the day, but Miles privately thought most edifying.</div>

<p>He was even better pleased when that night, at
the departure of his comrades, Samoset was ill or
feigned to be, so, spite of Mistress Hopkins, he
must be sheltered in her husband's house. Thus
for three days Miles dwelt under the same roof
with a live Indian, and ate at the same board, till
he came to have not the least tremor at sight of a
copper-colored face. Indeed, he neglected every
task he was set, to dog the Indian guest about the
street and make shy efforts at talk with him, and
he was heartily grieved when at last, on Wednesday,
Samoset went away into the forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"No doubt he'll come again, the mistress always
makes him so welcome," Ned Lister consoled
Miles, "and each time he goes, for his further
encouragement, they give him a present. This
morning they gave him a hat and shoes and stockings,
and a shirt and a loin cloth. I take it, 'tis
because I am what Master Hopkins calls a son of
Belial that it makes me to laugh, when I think of
Sagamore Samoset in an English headpiece with a
flapping brim."</p>

<p>"I'm mighty sorry he went," sighed Miles, uncomforted.
"I was learning the Indian words,
so I could talk to him presently, like Captain Standish.
'Cossaquot,' that means <i>bow</i>; and 'et chossucke'
is <i>a knife</i>; and 'petuckquanocke' is <i>bread</i>;
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ned yawned suggestively, and fell to work again.
He and Miles that afternoon were busied in the
spaded garden patch at the north end of the dooryard,
where they were pressing the seeds into the
soft earth. The sun was hot, and, as Miles worked,
he smeared his warm face with his fingers, till Ned
assured him he was all streaked brown, like an
Indian.</p>

<p>But though it was hot and dirty labor, it was far
manlier than to be ever dandling a baby; so Miles
toiled on earnestly, spite of Ned's indolent example,
and did not pause even to stretch his cramped legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
or straighten his aching back till mid-afternoon.
Then he started up at a noise of people hurrying
through the street, the sound of a quick footstep,
the rattle of the house-door.</p>

<p>"'Tis Master Hopkins has taken his musket and
gone forth," spoke Ned, who was lounging farther
down the garden. "Somewhat's afoot." Away he
went to look into the matter, and Miles ran stiffly
after.</p>

<p>Out in the street the men and boys, and even
one or two girls, were hastening toward the bluff
above the spring. As they went, a confused talking
spread among them, from which Miles learned
that yonder, on the great wooded hill across the
brook, Indians had been seen,&mdash;Indians who
brandished their bows and whetted their arrows in
defiance. Captain Standish and Master Hopkins
and two men from the <i>Mayflower</i> had gone down to
cross the brook and parley with them. Look, yonder
they went now!</p>

<p>From where the company had halted, high up
beyond Goodman Cooke's cottage, Miles could see
the bright river and the hill opposite, thick with
unleaved woods. Up its base wound slowly the
little band of Englishmen, now half-screened, now
wholly visible; but Miles looked from them, higher
up the slope, where the bare branches were agitated,
as if something moved among them. "'Tis the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
savages!" said one; but, strain his eyes as he
would, Miles saw through the bushes only the sad-colored
English doublets.</p>

<p>Yet, with an anxiety he scarcely comprehended,
the men lingered on the bluff, watching and discussing
in grave tones, till the Captain and his followers
came toilsomely up the path from the spring.
They had seen naught; the savages had not suffered
them draw nigh them, Captain Standish explained,
so briefly that he seemed curt, while his
puckered brows still were bent on the slope whence
the Indians had sent their defiance.</p>

<p>Slowly the little group of curious and troubled
people scattered, some of the weightier ones to
speak with the Governor and the Captain, others to
simpler tasks. Miles went back to his garden, but
the sunlight had now left that corner of the yard.
The great hill, where stood the guns, looked black
against the sky, and there seemed in all out-of-doors
a menace that made him glad at dusk to get
within the house. Throughout supper the men
kept from speaking of the savages with an elaborateness
that made their silence the more suspicious,
and the unspoken anxiety wrought on Miles till at
bedtime he smuggled Trug into the chamber and
made the dog lie near him.</p>

<p>Next morning, in the clear sunlight, Miles's
courage revived mightily, but his elders still looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sober. None the less, whether Indians threatened
or no, the work of the colony must be done: all
the morning men and boys trudged about their
tasks, though none went far afield; and after the
noon meal the men gathered once more at the
Common House, to consider the public business
which the first coming of Samoset had broken off.</p>

<p>Oceanus was ailing that afternoon and needed his
mother, so Miles had to mind Damaris for a dreary
hour. As he sat with her upon the doorstone, he
spied a noiseless little group of some five Indians
passing down the street, and, alert at once, he
begged leave to run see what might happen; but
Mistress Hopkins, all a-tremble herself, forbade
him venture out while those bloodthirsty wretches
were abroad, and even made him come in and shut
the door fast.</p>

<p>But speedily there sounded a rattling knock to
which the mistress must open, and in came the
men of the household, so hurriedly that straightway
the living room was in confusion. For the
great Sagamore Massasoit, with his brother Quadequina
and sixty warriors, was at hand, just across
the brook. One of the Indians, Squanto, who
could speak English, had gone back to bid him
enter the settlement, and the men of the colony
must get under arms to receive him; perhaps even
to defend themselves, Master Hopkins let a word fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>There followed a great throwing-on of buff-jackets
and buckling of sword-belts, while Giles,
newly appointed drummer to the colony, rattled
over the pots and kettles in a meaningless search
for his drumsticks, which some one had surely
moved from the place where he left them. Oceanus
wailed, Damaris, indignant at being neglected,
screamed aloud, Trug barked, and Mistress Hopkins
scolded, but somehow, in the midst of the
hurly-burly, the three men equipped themselves
and tramped away; and right at their heels went
Giles, with the drumsticks which Constance had
found.</p>

<p>But the door closed behind them and shut
Miles, a soldier in name only, in with the women
and children for another tedious hour. Damaris
found little rest in his arms those minutes, while he
ran from the western window, whence he could see
a bit of the street and the path to the spring, to the
eastern window, whence, far down the street, he beheld
the men gathered in martial line, all in armor,
which glimmered bravely in the afternoon sun.</p>

<p>He was still gazing down the street when Constance,
who had ventured to the other window,
called to him in a terrified voice: "Miles! Oh,
Miles! Come hither. 'Tis Indians indeed. Hundreds
of them!"</p>

<p>With no wish to see further, the girl drew away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
from the western window, and Miles thrust eagerly
into her place. Yes, there were Indians indeed,
swarms of them, it seemed at first sight, so he
flinched back a little from the casement. For they
were filing past the house, and that brought them
so near that Miles could see even the grotesque
figures in which their faces were painted. But soon
he perceived English musketeers marshalling them,
and he saw, too, that the savages were unarmed.
Their mission must be peaceful, he judged; so, eager
and unafraid, he stared at them, and was sorry when
the last one disappeared down the street.</p>

<p>Just then, as he turned from the window, sounded
the tap, tap of a drum. "It is the Governor and
the rest of the men with drum and trumpet marching
up the street," spoke Constance from the eastern
casement. "They have led the savages into the
unfinished cottage by the Common House, and now
they are going in to them."</p>

<p>Miles, at her side, squirmed with impatience.
"There's Jack yonder beneath the cottage window,"
he exclaimed, "and Francis and Joe. And there's
such a deal to see. And I'm sure they are all
good, harmless Indians." He gave a glance toward
the bedroom, where he could hear Mistress Hopkins
lulling Oceanus, then whispered Constance:
"Won't you mind Damaris? I'll tell you all about
it when I come back."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see not why you wish to go forth at such a
time, but I'll do 't for you. Run quick, ere stepmother
stop you," answered kind-hearted Constance;
and away sped Miles.</p>

<p>Still, he was too late to share in the main excitement,
for when he came into the yard of the unfinished
house, he found the door fast shut and all
the great folk, white or copper-colored, gone within.
Only two musketeers remained outside to keep
watch, and Edward Dotey, who was one of them,
proved so unsympathetic as to cuff Francis Billington
when he tried to get a peep in at the window.
Much discouraged, for where saucy Francis failed
to go there was no hope for the others, the small
boys of the colony gathered in a patient little group
in the dooryard to talk of these great happenings.</p>

<p>"Master Winslow has gone out amongst the
Indians," said Jack, "and they're holding him as
hostage for their old King. 'Twas right valiant of
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh! The Captain would 'a' gone just as
quick," Miles retorted jealously. "There's naught
to be afraid of, anyway. I would I were Giles
Hopkins, and stood there in the house with the
savages."</p>

<p>"My father is in there too," spoke little Love
Brewster, who had attached himself to Miles, "but
he is so good I do not think even an Indian would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
hurt him. But there were very many of them, and
if my mother had come close to see, I am sure she
would have been afraid. Perhaps I were best go
home and tell her there's no need to fear. You
come with me, pray you, Miles."</p>

<p>Young Rigdale had no wish to take his eyes
from the door of the house, but plainly the little
boy was fearful enough to want his company up the
street, so he went with him, and at the Elder's
cottage stayed a moment to reassure the women
grandly.</p>

<p>Dolly had no interest in Indians, since she found
in the case of Samoset that they did not carry about
with them a store of pretty baskets, such as the one
her father had brought her; but Priscilla Mullins
was eager to know everything, and questioned Miles
and listened to him most flatteringly, till he offered:
"If you wish to go forth and view the Indians,
Priscilla, I'll go and take care of you."</p>

<p>Whereat young Mistress Mullins laughed, and,
slipping her hand under his chin, kissed him for his
courtesy, "like a baby."</p>

<p>Red and indignant, Miles flung out of the house;
then forgot the insult, as he saw Giles, with a platter
in his hand, hurrying up the street from Governor
Carver's cottage. "What are you doing there?"
he called, running to intercept the elder lad.</p>

<p>"Fresh meat," panted Giles. "The Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
wished it for the King. I had this bit of a goose
from Mistress Carver, and now I've remembered a
mallard I saw stepmother set to boil."</p>

<p>It took him very few minutes to hurry into his
father's house, and out again with a second larger
platter balanced in one hand, but, short as the space
was, Miles had laid a plan. Stepping up to Giles,
he took from him Mistress Carver's dish of meat.
"Let me aid you," he proffered innocently.</p>

<p>"So that's what you're scheming," laughed Giles;
but he let Miles, under that pretext, come at his
side down the street, past the little group of envious
boys, up the doorstone of the unfinished cottage,
and so into the very council chamber.</p>

<p>The room was close and hazy with smoke from
the pipes of tobacco that the King and the chief of
the English puffed at, but, spite of the dimness,
Miles speedily made out the shapes of the Indians.
Black, red, yellow, and white, their faces were
partly or wholly smeared with paint, and, through
the wavering smoke-wreaths, their look was so grim
that for an instant he hesitated on the threshold.</p>

<p>But Giles went on, so he followed, across the
room, between what seemed endless rows of Indians
in hairy skins who stood or squatted on the floor,
up to the table, where sat a tall, stalwart savage.
Imitating Giles, Miles set down his dish of meat
before him, and, with an agitated bow, drew back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the wall, where he wedged himself in between Lister
and young Hopkins. "That's the King, yonder
at table," the latter whispered him softly.</p>

<p>He did not look at all as Miles thought a king
should look, that savage at the table. He wore a
scant covering of skins,&mdash;a dress like that of his
followers, save that the King had also about his
neck a great chain of white bone beads. His face
was painted a dark red; and face and head alike
were oiled so he looked greasy; he fed untidily
with his fingers, and sometimes, when he would
give a morsel to one of his followers, rent the meat
with his hands.</p>

<p>But, for all he seemed so busy with feeding, his
quick eyes were darting about the smoky room,&mdash;now
resting on the Governor, who sat at table near
him; now on the English musketeers who lined
the walls,&mdash;and, to Miles's thinking, the King
looked on them timorously; now on his own followers,
who crowded silently about him. One of
the Indians, squatting on the floor, held in his
hands the English trumpet, on which he tried to
blow, and, for a moment, the King paused to hark
with a child's wonder to his efforts, then once more
began tearing Mistress Hopkins's mallard.</p>

<p>When nothing but bones was left of the bird,
Giles slipped the platters from the table, and now
the serious work of the conference seemed to begin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Up from the floor behind the table, where they had
sat, rose two savages, who should interpret between
Massasoit and the Governor; the one was a stranger,
probably that Squanto whom Master Hopkins
had mentioned; the other, Miles's old acquaintance,
Samoset. A transformed Samoset, however, with
an English felt hat low on his brows and an English
shirt worn over his meagre native garments
after the manner of a carter's frock. Ned Lister,
standing rigid and soldierly against the wall, took
Miles a sudden dig in the ribs, and winked at
him with a "Didn't I tell you as much" expression.</p>

<p>Miles, on his good behavior, neither looked at
him nor smiled, but fixed his gaze on the men
about the table. The sun had now shifted down
the sky, so a great bar of light thrust in at the
western window. The yellow brightness flecked
across Elder Brewster's grizzled head, made Governor
Carver's stiff ruff even more dazzlingly white,
and gleamed back again from Captain Standish's
steel corselet. It rested, too, on the papers which
Master William Bradford had laid on the table
before him, but Master Bradford's grave face, as he
bent forward to write what the Governor bade, was
in shadow. The features of Massasoit, too, were
dark to see, but here and there, as the sunlight,
bursting through the smoke, wavered across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
room, the painted face or coppery bare shoulders of
one of his followers stood out.</p>

<p>The two interpreters jerked out the gutturals of
their outlandish tongue, to which the King grunted
assent, or now and again the Governor spoke a
measured word. But outside the window a bird
was singing in a high, purling strain; and Miles
wondered if it were a fat, red-breasted bird, and
thought more on its song and on the motes that
swam in the sunlight, than on what the Governor
was saying.</p>

<p>After all, he was glad when the conference broke
up. He was tired of standing stiffly, and the air of
the room was heavy; and the Indians, when they
neither ate nor played with trumpets, but just sat
stolid, were a bit stupid. He scuffed softly but
impatiently at the rear of the train, as the company
filed forth; the Governor and the King, side by
side, went first, and then, all in some semblance of
order, the Indian warriors and the English leaders
and soldiery.</p>

<p>Outside, a guard of honor formed about the
Governor and his guest, and gave them fitting
escort to the brook; but Miles remained behind
and roused the envy of his mates, with an account
of what he had seen, till, in fickle fashion, they
forsook him at the coming of a second guest,
Quadequina, the brother of Massasoit, who, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
turn, would have a taste of English hospitality.
He could not, however, compare in dignity and
importance with Massasoit; he was just a tall,
comely young savage, who liked English biscuit
and strong waters, but liked the English muskets
so little that his hosts good-naturedly laid them
aside. Massasoit was not cowardly like that, Miles
assured his comrades; Massasoit was every inch a
king, and it was a mighty honor to have been in
the same room with him.</p>

<p>Quadequina had been but a short time gone, and
the long shadows were filling the river valley with
a grayness, when back across the brook, quite unruffled
by his long detention, came Master Edward
Winslow. His fellow-colonists might be glad to
see him, and he to return unscathed to them, but
he carried it laughingly. He was all sound, save
that he was uncommon hungry,&mdash;Miles, following
admiringly, caught a scrap of his speech to Captain
Standish,&mdash;the Indians had tried to buy the armor
off his back and the sword from his side, and he
knew not but he might have sold them for a mess
of pottage, only he saw no such savory viand among
the savages, nor anything, indeed, but groundnuts.</p>

<p>Now that Master Winslow was returned, the
colonists released the Indians whom they had held
as hostages for him, and sent them away. Save
only Samoset and Squanto, no Indians were suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to remain in the settlement, but the rumor went
that King Massasoit and all his people had encamped
for the night on the wooded hill across the
brook, so a strict watch was set.</p>

<p>"Do you think there will be fighting yet?"
Miles questioned Giles, as they walked home to
supper. "Quadequina was afeard of our muskets.
I take it, we could beat those Indians."</p>

<p>"To be sure, there'll be no fighting," answered
Giles, as he tucked his drum under one arm in a
professional way. "We've struck a truce with the
savages."</p>

<p>Later, at supper, Miles heard it all explained.
This was a dolorous meal, for the meat had been
devoured by his Majesty, Massasoit, and Mistress
Hopkins was ill-tempered and rated Miles for running
away that afternoon, and, to add to her discomfort,
Samoset came blandly to sup with his old
entertainers. "This has been an ill day such as I
wish never to see the like of again," fretted the
poor woman.</p>

<p>"It is a happy day for our colony," said Master
Hopkins gravely. "Do you not realize, Elizabeth,
that we have this afternoon made a peace with our
heathen neighbors that, by the will of Heaven,
shall prove lasting? King Massasoit has covenanted
that none of his people shall do us harm as we go
abroad; and, if he be attacked, we shall aid in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
defense, or if other tribe of savages assail us, he
shall do us the like service. Yea, the hand of
Providence has been with us this day. Yesternight
it was all menace; but to-night we can hope for
peace."</p>

<p>Miles, in his place at table, looked at Samoset,
very solemn in his funny shirt and hat, and, blinking
sleepily at the candle, took little concern for
the earnestness of Master Hopkins's words. He
scarcely realized that this was almost the second
founding day of New Plymouth; but he did know
that he had stood within arm's reach of King
Massasoit, an exploit of which no other boy in the
colony could boast; and, when he went to bed, he
dreamed all night of red and blue and green
Indians.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>WHEN THE GOOD SHIP SAILED</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>EVEN Mistress Hopkins must at last somewhat
overcome her fear of the savages, else
her life would have been miserable beyond
endurance. For Massasoit having plainly made
the treaty in good faith, his people were ready at
all times to visit their English allies and eat of their
food. Coppery faces grew so common a sight in
the single street of New Plymouth that each boy
in the colony had his own little tale of a friendly
Indian encounter, and Miles Rigdale was no longer
alone in his experiences.</div>

<p>Still further to rob Miles of his prestige among
his fellows, his own particular Indian, the Sagamore
Samoset, with his hat and his shirt, which he used
in wet weather to remove carefully, lest they be
damaged, took himself off to his own land to the
eastward; and Miles found no one to fill his place.</p>

<p>To be sure, Plymouth had now a resident pensioner
in the Indian Squanto, but he lived with
Master Bradford, and so was accessible to other
boys as well as to Miles. "I see not why he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
let dwell among us," the latter said jealously, in the
early days of Squanto's stay.</p>

<p>"Because, if he were any but a heathen, one
might say this land where we have planted belongs
to him," Master Hopkins made a brief explanation,
which to Miles was no explanation at all.</p>

<p>But later, of a morning when Master Hopkins's
force of laborers was busied in building a fence
round the garden patch, Giles, who had listened to
the talk of his elders, took the trouble to set forth
the substance of it to Miles. "You'll understand,
this Squanto truly belongs at Plymouth. Back in
the time when an Indian village, Patuxet, stood
where we have settled, he dwelt here. But there
came an Englishman named Hunt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who was rather more of a knave than even a
trader should be," parenthesized Ned Lister, who,
seated comfortably on the ground near by, was
hammering the palings together.</p>

<p>"He was a scoundrel," said Giles, warmly. "He
toled Squanto and nineteen others from Patuxet, and
some from among the Nausets, on board his ship,
pretending he would truck with them; and then he
hoisted sail and steered away for Spain, where he
sold them all for twenty pound apiece. But somehow
this fellow Squanto made shift to reach England,
where a good merchant of London cared for him.
'Twas there he came by the knowledge of our tongue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
that he has. And at last they sent him back hither
to his own country; but meantime the plague had
been among them at Patuxet, and all were dead."</p>

<p>"The Lord removed the heathen to make way
for a better growth," said Dotey, who had just come
thither with an armful of fresh palings.</p>

<p>"Truly?" muttered Ned Lister. "Then I'm
thinking the Lord in His wisdom laid His hand
pretty heavily on the poor silly savages just for our
profit."</p>

<p>There was little enough love already between
Lister and Dotey, so Giles headed off a possibly
bitter argument by continuing hastily: "So, as my
father says, Squanto is, in a way, the owner of the
land here, and as such has a right to shelter and food
amongst us."</p>

<p>Miles listened to this story with a grave, stolid
face, such as the others kept, and made no word of
comment. But afterward he thought much of what
had been told him, and wondered if Squanto had
had a wife and copper-colored babies, and had come
home to find them dead. He felt sorry for the poor,
lone Indian, and watched him with new sympathy;
but to all appearances Squanto was more occupied
in consuming English biscuit and butter than in
grieving for his lost friends.</p>

<p>Whether or no he had a claim upon the English,
the Indian speedily showed himself able to repay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
them for any kindness. He told the men how they
must wait yet some days before they planted their
corn, and how there would then be plenty of fish in
the river, which they must set with the seed; and
much more that was useful. But nothing of the
Indian's arts impressed Miles so much as his prowess
in eel-catching, for he would go often into the forest
and return, after a few hours, with fat, sweet eels, as
many as he could lift in one hand.</p>

<p>Of an afternoon in April, nearly a fortnight after
the coming of Massasoit, Ned Lister and Giles Hopkins
went to the southward with Squanto on such
a fishing trip, and, as Miles was very eager to share
in it, they let him come too. Their course took
them over steep, wooded hills, where always they
had blue water close on the left hand, and, looking
back over their shoulders, could see the bay of
Plymouth, with its flanking headlands. A tender
leafage was upon the trees, and in the southern hollows,
where the birds sang, the air was warm; but
on each hilltop a chillier blast stung in the faces of
the fishermen and urged them to trudge more briskly.</p>

<p>At length they came to a gully, where two hills
curved into each other, and descended it, half running,
to the bank of a small river that flowed seaward
through a level reach. Here was where the
eels dwelt, Squanto gave his companions to understand;
and then, without spear or any implement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
he waded gently into the quiet water. The three
English-born, from the bank, watched him intently,
yet they scarcely realized how he did it, when he
suddenly made a swift dart forward, and rose with
a long, slimy thing writhing in his hands.</p>

<p>"Do you just tread 'em out with your feet,
Squanto?" Ned queried after a time, as, keeping
pace with the savage, they trailed along the bank.</p>

<p>When the Indian gave an "Um" that implied
assent, Ned presently suggested: "Say we venture
it, lads. It has a simple seeming. Tell us, Squanto,
can a white man take eels that way?"</p>

<p>"White man try," advised Squanto, stolidly. He
had caught enough for a mess, so he probably
thought that the splashings of the English fellows
would do no harm now.</p>

<p>Ned and Giles, stripping off shoes and stockings,
waded in; and Miles, not to be outdone, followed
after. The water felt stingingly cold against his bare
legs, and set his teeth chattering so he could not
talk. The very ooze of the river bed was clammy;
and then he suddenly found his tongue and gave a
frightened scream, as his toes touched something
that rolled beneath them.</p>

<p>"Did you take one, Miles?" cried Giles Hopkins,
splashing to the spot.</p>

<p>"I d-d-don't know," chattered Miles, from the
shore where he had sought refuge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Giles spattered to and fro a moment. "'Twas
naught but an old branch," he announced contemptuously.</p>

<p>"It was an eel," retorted Miles, "but, to be sure,
he will not stand there the day long till you choose
to come seek him."</p>

<p>With that he forced himself to put his purpling
feet into the water again, but, spite of this brave
showing, Ned and Giles would chaff him on his
flight, and even Squanto looked amused at the conduct
of the youngest of his allies.</p>

<p>Yet, for all they were so ready to laugh at him,
Miles noted his English comrades did not take a
single eel, and that gave him a kind of comfort.
But even then there was little pleasure in wading
through the icy water, in the expectation of stepping
on a soft, squirming thing; so he was not sorry
when Ned gave the order to take up the homeward
march.</p>

<p>The east wind, that had turned chillier as sunset
drew on, smote bleakly on the hilltops, and in the
hollows, where the shadows were creeping through
the undergrowth, the warmth had died out of the
air. The gathering darkness pressed ever closer
upon the fishermen; the sea on their right turned
gray and dim; the blue faded from the sky, and
the green of the distant headlands of the bay
changed to black. Just off the beach point they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
could dimly make out a dark bulk, where a single
speck of light showed&mdash;the old ship <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p>"They say she'll be hoisting sail for home soon,"
Giles spoke, as they trudged through the twilight,
with a surety that his comrades knew to what he
referred.</p>

<p>"So soon as the wind swings round into the
west," answered Ned. "Then she'll up sail, and
it's 'Eastward, ho!'"</p>

<p>Then presently, in the dusk, Ned began whistling
a sorry little tune, unlike those he was wont to sing,
very slow and monotonous, with a sudden rising to
a high note and as sudden a sinking again, like the
sharp indrawing of breath in a sob. "What song is
that, Ned?" Miles asked, because he would rather
hear Lister talk than whistle that pitiable strain.</p>

<p>"'Tis the Hanging-tune, Miley; the one to which
they set the last confessions of men who are condemned
to die." He fell to whistling once more
and half humming the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>"'Fortune, my foe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Why dost thou frown on me?'"</span><br /></div>

<p>and Miles harked to the tune till it went crying
itself through his head.</p>

<p>Next morning it still came back to him keenly,&mdash;the
walk in the twilight, the look of the distant ship,
the woful minor of the Hanging-tune. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
wind was hauling round to westward, and of a sudden
Indians and gardening and house-building ceased
to be matters that men talked of in the street; instead
they spoke of the going of the ship that had
borne them from England.</p>

<p>Already she had stayed longer on their shores
than any had expected, because of the sickness that
had been among her crew. But now, on shore and
on ship, the sickness was stayed; just half the settlers
lay buried on the bluff, and the crew of the
<i>Mayflower</i> mustered in diminished numbers, yet
enough survived and in recovered health to work
the ship back to England. With the first favoring
wind she would set forth upon her voyage; and
with that bit of sure information went another, that
Master Jones had offered to take home in her any
one of the settlers who might wish to go.</p>

<p>"Right generous of him, is't not?" Ned Lister
spoke bitterly to Miles. "Who does he think is
going with him? The Elder and the Governor
and Master Bradford, all the chiefs, if they showed
their faces in England, they'd be clapped up in
prison. And the lesser men, or even our great
Master Hopkins here, they've ventured all their
substance in this plantation. If they go back, they
must starve or beg in London streets, and 'tis as
easy and pleasant to starve here. There's none in
the settlement I know of has the wish to go home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
save myself, and I cannot go, because I've sold my
time to Hopkins, the more fool I!"</p>

<p>"Why did you ever come hither, if you hate it
so?" Miles questioned.</p>

<p>"Because a penny fell wrong side up," Ned answered.
"I woke up in London one fine morning,
with no shirt to my back and but one penny in my
pocket. 'It's either 'list for the wars, or get me
into a new country and start afresh,' I said, so I
tossed up the penny,&mdash;heads Bohemia, tails America.
It fell tails; so I sold Stephen Hopkins my
three years' time in return for my passage over.
And a precious fool I was! Faith, I'd liefer dig
ditches in England than play even at governor here.
And so soon as my time's out!"</p>

<p>Miles listened soberly, but with no sympathy;
he did not understand why a tall, grown fellow like
Ned should think on home with such longing. He
did not care himself; he had come to New Plymouth
to live, and he looked forward to the departure of
the <i>Mayflower</i> as a novel happening in the round of
everyday occurrences.</p>

<p>Yet when it befell, it seemed quite a matter-of-fact
event. A clear breezy morning it was, and, as
the household sat at their early breakfast, Francis
Cooke came leisurely to tell Master Hopkins that
the wind was setting steady from the west, and
Master Jones had rowed ashore to bid his former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
passengers good-by; so soon as the tide was at
flood, the ship would put forth.</p>

<p>There was wood and water to fetch as every day;
and Miles did the tasks hastily. As he came down
the path by Cooke's house, he could feel the wind
stirring his hair, and yonder in the harbor the waves
were ruffling, and the dim old sails of the <i>Mayflower</i>,
unfurled, bellied in the gusts.</p>

<p>When he had set the dripping bucket within the
living room, he ran down toward the bluff, to see
what more was to see, but, finding his playmates
lingering by the door of the Common House, he
joined them. Within the house, they told him,
Master Jones was drinking a friendly draught with
the colonists, and taking his leave. Presently, indeed,
the Master, a low, broad-shouldered figure,
in his wide breeches and loose jacket, came forth,
attended by most of the men of the colony, and
rolled off to the landing place.</p>

<p>Some of the boys straggled respectfully behind
their elders, but Miles raced with those who ran
to be first at the landing. There, alongside the
rock, rode the ship's longboat, and Will Trevor and
several of the lesser men stood talking with the
sailors who sat in her. The youngsters, too, would
gladly have borne a part, but the Master, coming
right on their heels across the sand, broke up the
little group; he was speaking boisterously with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Governor, so his loud voice could be heard even
above the confusion of the embarkation.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was all so noisy and hurried that nothing
of those last moments remained clear in Miles's
mind; he remembered only that men spoke of letters
and packets, and the Master wished them many
a "God be wi' you," and there was a bustling to and
fro and a deal of hand-shaking. Then the Master,
sitting in the stern seat, was cursing at his sailors;
the width of blue water between the longboat and
the landing rock was increasing; and for a moment
Miles watched mechanically the sway and swing of
the seamen's bodies, as, bending to their oars, they
rowed the boat away.</p>

<p>When at length he turned slowly about, he was
aware that, halfway up the rugged slope of the
bluff, a little group of women, all that survived in
the colony, were standing, and the children with
them. He scrambled up to be with Dolly, why,
he could not say, only somehow he wanted to be
sure she was safe and near him then; and he noted
Mistress Carver, who sat upon a stone with her
hands clasped tensely in her lap, and Priscilla Mullins,
whose hair blew unheeded about her face,
while she gazed out to sea.</p>

<p>He almost stumbled over Wrestling Brewster
and the little Samson boy, who had sat down on the
turf and unconcernedly were playing with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
bright pebbles; but he did not pause to speak to
Wrestling, just clambered a few feet higher up the
bluff, where Dolly, holding to Mistress Brewster's
gown, stood with her wistful face turned seaward.
"Look you closely, Dolly," he greeted her. "See,
they're hoisting sail on board the <i>Mayflower</i>."</p>

<p>Dolly, pressing up to him, whispered for her
only reply: "Do you mind, Miles, how we came
in on the ship, and mammy and daddy with us? I
wish we'd all stayed in England."</p>

<p>"Now hush, Dolly," Miles admonished in a
gruff tone, and scowled vexedly as the little sister,
hiding her face against his doublet, began to cry.
Then, half pitying, he bent to speak to her, when
a sudden gasp, as if the women about him all drew
in their breath, made him look to the harbor.
There he saw the <i>Mayflower</i>, with the western wind
swelling her dingy sails, had heaved up anchor, and
was heading out upon the ocean.</p>

<p>The sun was bright and made the dirty sails
gleam like silver; the water was blue, and the wind
was brisk; and the ship stood seaward swiftly, very
swiftly. Miles thought on how she had set forth
from Southampton; and he knew that on board
men would be clattering across her deck, and hauling
at ropes, and the Master would be bellowing
orders.</p>

<p>But on shore a great silence had fallen. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
most careless of the men had no word to say, while
of the graver sort some had bowed their heads, and
some, coming higher up the bluff, had drawn close
to their wives and children. For a moment there
was no sound save the lap of waves about the great
gray landing rock, and the swish of shingle as the
swell receded; then suddenly one of the women&mdash;it
was Mistress White, six weeks a widow, who
stood with her baby in her arms and her other little
child holding to her skirts&mdash;burst out sobbing.</p>

<p>Miles gazed about him in wonder. Why, men
never cried; Captain Standish's face now was hard
as a stone; and he himself had not the least inclination
to shed a tear. But among the women round
him was a stifled weeping, so anguishing for being
half suppressed, that some pity mingled with his
contempt, and, with a feeling that he was ashamed
to listen, he slipped away from the bluff. He
thought he were best run up on the great hill to
watch the <i>Mayflower</i> depart; and he found that his
friend Jack and several other boys had had the same
thought.</p>

<p>All together they raced up the street to see who
should gain the hilltop first, and by the time they
came thither, with laughing and struggling, had
clean forgot their elders, who, from the bluff below,
watched the receding ship through a dazzle of tears.
From the top of the hill the lads could see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
white sail of the <i>Mayflower</i> in the offing, out beyond
Sagaquab, speeding ever farther into the horizon;
but Miles never saw it vanish, for Francis Billington
had discovered a nest of snakes at the other
side of the hill; so, in the midst of their watching,
the boys must run thither and look upon the wriggling
little creatures, then scrupulously stone them
all to death.</p>

<p>When Miles clambered again to the hilltop, there
was never a distant glimmer of a sail upon the sea;
but he could not think of the ship's departure sadly,
with the day so fair and his time at his disposal.
He felt hungry, though, so he ran down to the
house a moment to eat his dinner; and, for all it
was long past the noon hour, he found no dinner
ready.</p>

<p>Ned was out by the woodpile, nailing together
a hand-barrow, with a sudden fierce spurt of energy,
but he was in a sulky temper; and within the house
Constance went about with her eyes red. She gave
Miles a piece of bread in his hand, and bade him
run away and eat it; stepmother had shut herself
in her chamber, and father was with her, trying to
comfort her. "I see not why you all make such a
to-do because the old ship has sailed," Miles spoke,
with his mouth full.</p>

<p>"Because we're left alone. Because no ship will
come ere the autumn. Maybe it will never come,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Constance burst out, with sudden passionateness.
"And we are here, and home is there, and the ship
has gone. You'd understand, if you were older."</p>

<p>No, Miles did not understand yet. What with
the excitement and the change, in spite of the sad
bearing of those about him, the meaning of it all
did not come home to him till next morning. He
had risen early with the others and run forth to
fetch wood for the morning fire. The sun was just
reddening the horizon line, but the rest of the world
looked faint and gray. A white mist, rolling off
the fields, was shrinking away inland from the sea
whence it had come. But out to sea he could distinguish
clearly the dusky beach point, and the
islands and&mdash; There he rubbed his eyes. No,
it was no trick of the mist. There was the old
anchoring ground, but it was empty; the clumsy,
old, dark hulk was gone.</p>

<p>Miles walked on to the woodpile, trying hard
to whistle, but the only strain that came was a sorry
snatch in a minor key,&mdash;the Hanging-tune. The
chill of the dawning struck into his bones. Once
more he looked to the anchoring ground that was
vacant; then he sat down suddenly among the
damp logs. He did not cry,&mdash;he was too big and
old for that,&mdash;but he leaned his folded arms against
a log, and hid his face between them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE SOWING OF THE FIELDS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"TO be sure, though, I was not weeping,"
Miles declared to Constance, who came
out from the house to see why he tarried
so long at the woodpile, "for I never even thought
on going back to England."</div>

<p>He little guessed that, at one time, the leaders of
the colony had spoken seriously of returning Dolly
and himself to the home-country. But Master
Hopkins had urged that, in such case, the children
might be drawn back into the faith of the Church
of England, from which their father had sought to
snatch them; and Elder Brewster had added that
it was a weary journey for such little folk, and no
prospect at the end save of hard fare among grudging
kindred.</p>

<p>John Rigdale left no near relatives; and his distant
cousins, to whom the children would have to go,
were poor tenant-farmers, just as he had been, who
would find it burdensome to feed two more mouths.
For Miles and Dolly, not only would childhood
prove hard and laborious, but there would be nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
better to look forward to; as the boy grew to manhood,
he could hope only to toil for daily hire on
some farmer's land. "Unless he fling away his
soul's welfare by going as a mercenary in some iniquitous
foreign war," said Master Isaac Allerton;
whereat Captain Standish smiled a little behind his
beard, but made no answer.</p>

<p>But here in New Plymouth, though Miles would
have plenty of work to do, he would have, as his
inheritance from his father, a claim to a share of
land and of whatever cattle or other property the
settlers should hereafter hold in common. By the
time he was a man, there would be enough for him
to have a small farm of his own, where he could live
in more comfort than he would have known in
England; and, till he was grown, Master Hopkins
was willing to feed and shelter him, in return for
what labor he could do.</p>

<p>As for Dolly, her case was simple enough, for if
Miles stayed, she stayed; and Mistress Brewster
was quite determined that the little girl should stay
in no house but hers. So the <i>Mayflower</i> sailed
away, and Miles Rigdale, with his little household,
remained behind; and he never dreamed that people
had thought of continuing the colony without
his aid.</p>

<p>The boy had some cause to rate his services
highly, for, in the weakened condition of the settlement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
every atom of strength had to be used, and
tasks were set for him as seriously as for burly
Edward Dotey. The full working-force of New
Plymouth mustered but twenty-two men,&mdash;counting
in the venerable Elder, the Governor, and the
Doctor, who all labored with their hands as readily
as the rest,&mdash;and nine boys&mdash;some half-grown
fellows, like Giles and Bart Allerton, who, at a
pinch, could bear a musket and do almost a man's
work, and some small rascals, like Miles himself,
who, with the best intentions, did not always, for
lack of strength or of wisdom, accomplish what was
bidden them.</p>

<p>But, old or young, laggard or brisk, every male
member of the colony was expected to turn out now
and bear a hand, for the mid-April season approached,
and the precious corn, that was to feed
the settlement, must be planted. To the elders, it
looked like a stretch of hard work, but Miles hailed
it joyously, as a dignified, manly labor.</p>

<p>It began excitingly, with the coming of the alewives
up the river, just as Squanto had foretold;
and straightway some of the men set to taking them
with seines, while others with hoes scored up the
rough soil of the cleared fields to the north, that
once had been the planting land of the Indians of
Patuxet. Still others got out the corn, a precious
supply of seed which they had found buried in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Indian basket under the sand of Cape Cod, and
had made bold to take against this sowing time.</p>

<p>For the present, Miles's part was only to splash
about at the river brink, where he fancied he was
hauling at the seines, or to carry a bucket of water
to the workers in the field, or bring a stouter hoe
from the storehouse. Planting was no labor, just
sport, he went to assure Dolly, at the end of the
first twelve hours.</p>

<p>He tried to see his little sister once each day, but
this time the work had been kept up so late that
it was past twilight before he could run across the
street to Elder Brewster's cottage. A lingering
warmth was in the evening air, so Dolly and tall
Priscilla Mullins, their faces dim in the candlelight
that shone from within the living room behind
them, were sitting on the doorstone. Some one
else stood leaning against the doorpost, some one
with a deep voice, who called Miles by name.</p>

<p>"Is it you, John Alden?" the boy asked, and,
because Alden was the Captain's friend, would have
talked to him, had not Dolly, saying she had a great
secret to tell him, dragged him away, round the
corner of the cottage.</p>

<p>"Now guess what 'tis, Miles," she bade, as they
halted in the ray of light that streamed from the
house-window beside them.</p>

<p>"I cannot guess, Dolly. Be not so childish."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd give you three guesses. 'Tis something
Love and I found in the woods, up beyond the
spring, on a southern hillside. 'Twas so far I was
near afraid, but I am glad I went. We were playing
in the dead leaves, and we found these. Look
on them."</p>

<p>She drew her hand from her small bodice, with
three wilted pink flowers clenched tightly in it.
They were small flowers, of a star-shaped form and
a rare, deep pink color, but Miles scarcely heeded
color or size in his enjoyment of their sweet, spicy
smell. They were unlike any blossom he had ever
seen, so he was not ashamed to show his interest,
even if a flower was a girlish trifle. "You and
Love found them, Dolly? And no one else
knows?"</p>

<p>"'Tis a secret," Dolly nodded. "We told only
Wrestling and Priscilla and Mistress Brewster.
Ay, and the Elder too, because Mistress Brewster
said perchance he might know what flower it was,
he is so wise. And John Alden, Priscilla told him.
And Love told Harry Samson and Milly Cooper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a mighty great secret when all the colony
knows it," Miles said sarcastically, and then, at
Dolly's hurt look, was sorry; so he added, "but I'm
glad to know't, Dolly, and I'll go seek for some
myself."</p>

<p>"There are buds yonder on the hillside, but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
blossoms. Maybe, though, we could find some,
if we went and searched. Priscilla wishes to get
some too. Oh, Miles, could we not all three go
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I must work," Miles answered proudly. "I'm
not a child or a girl, so I cannot stop to play."</p>

<p>Yet he was child enough to think he should like
to go get a handful of those rare, pretty flowers.
After he got them, he would not greatly care for
them, but there would be the zest of owning something
that every boy in the colony did not own; and
if he gave the flowers to Dolly or to Constance, it
would please them, since they were girls. So, before
dawn next morning, Miles tumbled out of bed,
and, taking in his hand the hunch of bread that
formed his breakfast, ran away up beyond the
spring. Perhaps before work-time he could find a
blossom or two, he thought; and so grubbed hopefully
among the damp, dead leaves of the hillslope.</p>

<p>The mist that precedes the sunrise melted from
the air; a bird sang faintly in the distance; and
even amidst the undergrowth the light grew yellow
and cheerful; work-time was near, and Miles had
found only a poor half-dozen blossoms. He hated
to give over, but there was no help for it; so, getting
slowly to his feet, he was starting down the path
to the settlement, when a man crashed out through
the bushes on his left. It was John Alden, Miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
saw at once, and he carried a great handful of the
pink flowers.</p>

<p>That was palpably an unfair arrangement, Miles
held, so, as he fell into step at Alden's side, he
queried: "You did not come hither and strip our
place, did you?"</p>

<p>"Whose place, lad?"</p>

<p>"Why, mine and Dolly's and Priscilla's and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think I should dare plunder the holding
of so many proprietors? I have been to northward."</p>

<p>Miles was silenced a moment, then insinuated,
"John Alden, what do you want of posies? You're
a man."</p>

<p>"Well, what do <i>you</i> want of them, Miles?" John
smiled down at him.</p>

<p>"I'm going to give mine away; I'm taking them
to the Elder's cottage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give them away there, eh? To Mistress Mullins,
now, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No, to be sure," Miles said indignantly. "I
do not like Priscilla Mullins."</p>

<p>"Then you are the only one of that mind in
New Plymouth. Why do you not like her?"</p>

<p>Miles went in silence a time, kicking at each
hump and hummock in his path, but Alden was
waiting for his answer, and he wished to please him.
"Well, if you must know, John Alden," he broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
out at last, "I do not like Priscilla Mullins because
she kissed me."</p>

<p>Alden began to laugh, then, suddenly picking
Miles up by the back of his doublet, shook him a
little. "Miles Rigdale," he said solemnly, as he
set the boy, rather breathless, on his feet again,
"you are an ungrateful little cub."</p>

<p>Miles held that a most uncalled-for charge, but
he had no time to defend himself, for just then
they came over the brow of the hill by Cooke's
cottage and saw men astir in the street, so the day's
labor must be beginning. Miles ran to join Francis
and Jack, and, in bragging to his comrades of his
flowers, forgot to take them to Dolly. That night,
when he stopped to have a word with her, he told
her all about them, but he found that she was not
interested in a story of six blossoms, seeing that
Priscilla Mullins, since the morning, had had a fair
large bunch of them, such as no one else in the
settlement could show.</p>

<p>But in the days that followed Miles had little
time to go seeking flowers on the hillslopes, or
gossiping with his sister in the twilight. For, with
never a minute of daylight to rest, the whole colony
worked now in good earnest,&mdash;taking alewives in
the brook, tugging them up into the fields, setting
the little hills with corn seed and with fish to keep
it moist. To crown all, the planting fell in a season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of heat, and an intense heat, unlike the milder
warmth of England, that sapped the heart of the
stoutest worker.</p>

<p>The first day Miles was bidden to plant corn,
putting two shiny alewives into each hole, and Jack
Cooke was set to plant the row next him. But
unhappily they chattered so much that Miles presently
realized, in some horror, that he had supplied
several hills with alewives, but no corn, and, while
he was pulling up the ground to set the matter
right, came Master Hopkins. He was angry; not
that he blustered, but he cuffed Miles smartly, and,
saying he could not be trusted at such important
work, sent him down to the shore to labor hereafter.</p>

<p>From that time on, Miles tugged fish,&mdash;a dreary
task, in which he was coupled with Francis Billington,
another scatter-head. They had a great flat
Indian basket, in which they heaped the alewives,
taken all slippery from the big pile that lay upon
the river brink; then they would lift the basket
between them, to each a handle, and, panting and
heaving, struggle up the steep bank from the river,
and so through the settlement, out to the hot, open
fields.</p>

<p>It was not a great load they could carry at one
time, so their usefulness depended on the number of
trips they made, but there they were sluggish. Often
the basket upset, and they had to sit down to refill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
it; and again, more and more frequently as the hot
days went on, they must halt to quarrel, when
Francis vowed Miles was bearing down on his end
of the basket, and Miles declared Francis was not
doing his share.</p>

<p>One morning it came to such a pass that Miles
took a basket by himself, but he found the journey
single-handed so hard that he was in even less hurry
than usual to return from the fields and get a
second load. Loitering along, he was amusing
himself by trying to carry on his head the empty
fish-basket, which <i>would</i> fall off, when, as he paused
to pick up the troublesome article for the fifth time,
Captain Standish, coming shirt-sleeved and grimy
from the fields, overtook him. Rather guiltily,
Miles straightened up very erect, and said, "Good
morrow, sir," as he always said it to the Captain.</p>

<p>"You're journeying back to the brook, Miles?"
asked Standish. "At this speed you'll not come
thither ere dinner-time."</p>

<p>"I'm hastening now, sir," Miles answered, accepting
the words as an invitation to trot along at
the other's side.</p>

<p>The Captain had his own concerns to look to,
plainly, by the way he tramped along, but, right
in the midst, he glanced down at his small companion
and asked unexpectedly: "Where are your
shoes, Miles?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I could not wear them," the boy explained,
kicking his bare feet in the sand. "Down by the
river 'tis very wet. And then 'tis hot, so I laid off
my doublet and my shoes and stockings too. I
like to go barefoot," he added defensively. "In
England, they never suffered me; they said only
beggar children went barefoot. But&mdash;" his voice
grew suddenly anxious, "I am sure my mother
would think it right now, do not you, sir?"</p>

<p>The Captain did not look convinced.</p>

<p>"It is a great saving to my shoes," murmured
Miles.</p>

<p>"You were better save your feet," the Captain
answered. "When your shoes wear out, there'll
be new ones for you. Now do you go to the house
and put them on, before you step on a thorn or do
yourself some hurt." His tone was brusque, and
he hurried at once about his business, as if he had
no time to waste.</p>

<p>Obediently Miles went to the house to finish
dressing; he was a little sorry, because he liked the
fun of going barefoot in the soft dirt, yet, on the
whole, it was pleasant to have Captain Standish
speak to you and order you into your shoes, as if he
had some concern for you. So flattered did he feel,
indeed, that he only smiled in a superior way when
Francis Billington, barelegged and unregenerate,
sneered at him for putting on his shoes and stockings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>But that was the last happening of the week
which Miles remembered with enjoyment, for the
first excitement had now gone out of the labor,
yet the work dragged heavily on. All through the
weary day he felt the weight of the basket pulling at
his arm and the heat of the steady sun scorching
upon his bare head; and at night, when he lay on
his pallet, with his feet throbbing and his back aching,
he dreamed of tugging fish up the breathless
pitch of a never-ending bluff.</p>

<p>A little respite came on the Sabbath, when, of
course, no work could be done, but with Monday's
light all were in the fields once more. It was a day
of sweltering heat; the rays of the sun seemed beaten
upward again by the steaming earth, and the languid
air was heavy and sick. Toward the fiercest hour,
about noon, as Miles was panting through the fields
on a return trip to the brook, Master Carver called
to him.</p>

<p>The Governor had knelt to set the corn at the
head of one of the rows; his doublet was off and his
hands were grimy, but, for all the heat, Miles saw
that his high, bald forehead was quite dry of perspiration.
"Here, lad," he said, as Miles ran to
him, "can you fetch us a pail of water hither to
drink?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Governor," Miles piped in a respectful
treble, and, much impressed by the importance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
his errand, trotted off briskly. At the spring he
longed to dally a moment, to drink of the water and
to stir up the great green frog who lived in the cool
sand of the bottom, but, so soon as his bucket was
filled, he resolutely turned back through the glaring
heat to the fields.</p>

<p>Short as the time had been, a change had taken
place. At first he thought it a mere trick of the
dazzling light, but, as he looked again, he saw
that indeed most of the men had risen from labor
and, drawn together, were gazing in his direction.
Nearer at hand, he beheld two coming toward the
settlement; the one was John Howland, a member
of the Governor's household, and the other, who
leaned heavily upon his arm, was the Governor himself.
They passed within arm's length of the boy,
and Miles took note how the Governor's down-bent
face was now of a dull reddish hue, and he noted,
also, how the grime of his homely toil still clung to
his limp hands.</p>

<p>Surprised and a little awed, though he scarcely
could tell why, Miles tugged on into the fields, and,
finding Goodman Cooke among those who stood
gazing after the Governor, asked him eagerly what
was wrong. "Why, naught," spoke Cooke, "only
Master Carver complains of his head; 'tis along o'
the heat, so the Doctor ordered him back to his
house to rest. He'll be well again by eventide."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>But with eventide the word went among the colonists
that Governor Carver lay unconscious, and
at those tidings faces grew grave. Miles, in his
youthfulness, gave little thought to it all; he was
more concerned with his own half-flayed hands
and aching legs than with Master Carver's illness,
and each day these physical pangs grew
keener.</p>

<p>The height of misery came on a sultry afternoon
toward the close of the week, a breathless, stifling
time, when, for sheer weariness and hopelessness,
Miles sat down in the hot dirt in the middle of the
field and thought he never could rise again. Yet
he scrambled up briskly, when he saw his guardian
approach, though Master Hopkins, whose face was
very grave, did not scold the boy, but, after a first
sharp look, bade him go rest in the shade till the day
was out. "The hot sun is deadly," he said, as to
himself; but Miles realized only that he was bidden
to cease from labor.</p>

<p>He dragged himself back to the house, where he
lay down upon his bed, and watched the little patch
of sunlight clamber higher up the wall and harked
to the drowsy sounds of out-of-doors; then heard
nothing clearly till the men tramped in to supper.
He sat up slowly, and listened to catch what gossip
they might bring; their voices were subdued, and
he half guessed what had befallen ere he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Master Hopkins say solemnly that the good Governor
Carver was dead.</p>

<p>Miles thought on it the night long; this death,
lonely by itself, was so much more awesome than the
crowded sicknesses of the last winter. It seemed
the order of life must show some change, but, with
the heat of the next rising day, the colonists, as
usual, only more silent, filed forth to their labor
in the fields. For whether men were well or ill,
or lived or died, the corn that was the hope of the
settlement must be planted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE TWO EDWARDS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE fields of New Plymouth at last were
sown,&mdash;twenty acres of Indian corn and
six of English seed, wheat, barley, and
pease,&mdash;enough to yield an ample harvest. There
was besides another field, where the corn, however
tall it grew, would never be reaped, for, that the
savages might not know the number of the dead,
it was planted upon the graves of those who
perished in the winter's sickness.</div>

<p>Among them lay John Carver, buried honorably
with such poor military pomp as the colony could
show its governor, and with a more precious tribute
of grief for a good man lost. Near him lay now
his wife Katharine, who at his death had grieved
and pined, till within six weeks they had dug for
her a grave in the new-sown corn-land.</p>

<p>Master Bradford was the new governor; a grave,
wise-headed gentleman, with a gift of kindly speech
and a shrewd sense of humor, but, to Miles, his
greatest claim to respect was that the interpreter
Squanto had chosen to dwell with him. For Miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Rigdale, to use Mistress Hopkins's vexed phrase,
was "ever beating the street after the heathen savage."
It must be owned that to his guardians he
was a troublesome boy; not a bad boy, but a careless
fellow, who, though he might mean to do well, was
likely, when sent to weed in the fields, to be found
swimming in the river, or hunting strawberries on
the hills, or fishing with Squanto.</p>

<p>Miles did not reason out his new dislike for responsible
labor, did not take into account the influence
of lazy Edward Lister, or the distractions of
the spring and early summer in this new country;
but he did feel there was a difference between working
with his father, when he knew the harvest would
be for his mother and Dolly, and grubbing in a corner
of a great field that was the property of no man,
but should feed the whole colony. He no longer
took pride in his labor, and, if he had taken any,
Mistress Hopkins's dissatisfied comments would
have destroyed it. Yet, much though he disliked
the bustling woman with the sharp tongue, he neither
disliked nor feared her the half as much as he
disliked and feared her husband.</p>

<p>Years later, when he had come to manhood,
Miles was able to think on Master Hopkins with
gratitude, for, in all honesty, this severe, undemonstrative
man used him like a son, as kindly as he
used his own boy, Giles. Except in the stress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
planting-time, Miles was never set to tasks beyond
his strength; he was well fed,&mdash;as the fare of the
colony went,&mdash;well sheltered, decently clad, while
the little store of his father's goods was scrupulously
left untouched for his later use.</p>

<p>Master Hopkins tried also, conscientiously, to
keep him to the path of strict virtue, with admonitions,
and, if need were, with corrections. It was
an age of whippings, and, on occasion, Miles was
whipped painstakingly. Master Hopkins's floggings
were, on the whole, not so severe as Goodman
Rigdale used to give his son, but Miles
resented them with an amazing outburst of anger.
"You are not my father; you have no right to beat
me," he cried, the first time Master Hopkins took
a birch rod to him, and, swinging round in a fury,
he lustily kicked his chastiser's shins.</p>

<p>After that one attempt and the sorry consequences
which it entailed, he never again tried to defend himself,
but, though he had to submit, the old feeling
remained; to the pain and shame of a beating was
now added a rankling sense of the injustice and, so
to speak, of the illegality of it all.</p>

<p>Beatings, though, were something every boy in
the colony, even the sober Giles, had a good share
of, so Miles made shift to endure; but Master
Hopkins presently devised a new-fangled means of
persecution, for he insisted on teaching him to read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy had clung to the black-letter Bible because
it was his father's, and sometimes of a Sunday,
between the morning and afternoon teachings at the
Common House, when it grew irksome to sit quiet
and do nothing, would take the book and spell out
half a chapter, and amuse himself with looking at
the funny black letters. But one Sunday, a warm
May Sunday, when Miles was lying with his book
in the young grass in the shadow of the house,
Master Hopkins, noting his unusual employment,
bade him read aloud to him, and, as he was a man
of education, was honestly shocked that, as he put
it, "the lad could scarce spell out his mother-tongue."</p>

<p>From that time dated Miles's tribulations. It
was useless to protest that he could read well
enough, he did not wish to read better; Master
Hopkins's decree went forth that every night
after supper the boy was to come to him with his
Bible, and read aloud a chapter. Miles never reflected
that, after a day of hard labor in the fields
or woods, or of serious consultation with the other
leaders of the colony, it could be neither restful nor
pleasant to Master Hopkins to hear a stupid little
boy stumble through a dreary waste of words. But
he was quite aware of the unjust fact that the space
of daylight, in the long summer evenings after
supper, was the time when all the other lads were
at liberty to play, while he must drone out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
chronicles of dead and gone Hebrews with unpronounceable
names.</p>

<p>The reading lesson always took place just without
the house-door, where there was a bench on which
Master Hopkins sat; Miles stood beside him,
where he could see the harbor and the street, with
the boys passing down it to the beach, perhaps;
and where, too, it was convenient for Master Hopkins
to cuff his ears when his attention strayed hopelessly
from the book to the affairs of his playmates.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when he wished to get away and join
them in carrying out a long-laid plan of sport, Miles
would pore over his chapter twice or thrice in the
day, and so, when evening came, be able to read
it fairly. But on such occasions Master Hopkins
always said there would be time to finish another
chapter; and when it came to that, poor, disappointed
Miles always stumbled, so that his lesson
ended in disgrace and bitter rebuke.</p>

<p>Early in July, however, he had a blissful holiday,
for Master Hopkins went with Master Winslow
and Squanto far inland to visit King Massasoit, so
for five days there was no one to bid Miles read a
word. Neither did any one whip him, for all he
shirked his weeding, and ran away to fish in the
harbor with Ned Lister and the sailor, Trevor, and
played by the brookside with the other boys till
long after dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Dotey, to be sure, one morning when Miles forgot
to fetch a supply of water, and he had to fetch
it himself, threatened to "swinge" him; he was a
steady fellow, was Dotey, and, since Giles was but
a lad, in his master's absence was tacitly admitted to
the headship of the household. But when he talked
of beating Miles, up rose Ned, and called him, with
an oath, a great bully, swaggering in his little ha'penny
borrowed authority, and threatened, if he laid
hands on the little fellow, to break his head for him.</p>

<p>It was in the living room this happened, just before
the noon meal; Miles remembered afterward
the good smell of the roast fish Mistress Hopkins
was setting on the table, and what an overpowering
heat came from the great fire on the hearth. He
was standing near the fireplace, backed up against
the wall, a little conscience-stricken and fearful of
a whipping, but still more frightened by the vehemence
of the two men. Lister had swaggered
across the floor, and stood before him, and Miles
was glad of his protection, though he half realized
that it was not alone the desire to defend him, but
the desire to defy Dotey, the trusted and sober, that
spoke in Ned's tone.</p>

<p>Constance's quiet voice, as she stepped between
the two young men, quelled the squabble: "Don't
curse so, pray you, Ned. And, Ed Dotey, do not
you whip Miles; he only forgot&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"He does not merit whipping," spoke slow Giles,
who held his own little resentment that his father's
servant was set in authority over him.</p>

<p>Mistress Hopkins interrupted tartly that Miles
needed a strong hand to correct him, and Dotey was
quite in his right; her approval made it lawful
enough for the young man to carry out his intention,
but Dotey, like a discreet fellow, had no wish to
bring about a scuffle with Lister and a hot family
quarrel in his master's absence. So he said, as if it
were a concession, that he would do as Constance
asked, and let Miles off this time; and with that
they all sat down peaceably to dinner. Miles ate his
full share of the fish, and, believing this episode
happily ended, put it quite out of his head.</p>

<p>He had good cause to remember it some ten days
later. By then Master Hopkins had returned, so it
was necessary for all to be busy, and Miles weeded
in the corn-field till his back ached, and every evening
read his chapter in the Bible. But one morning,
a hot, dull morning with an overcast sky, Ned and
Giles planned to go with Squanto to fish for perch
in a pond far up in the woods, and Miles received
a reward for his diligence of the last few days in a
permission to go with them. Giles and the Indian
started on ahead, to take the bait, while the two others
stayed to make ready the extra tackle, which, being
left to Ned's management, was always in a snarl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Lister was sitting on the bench by the house-door,
whistling a little, as he disentangled lines and adjusted
hooks, and Miles, kneeling on the grass
beside him, was giving what help he could, when
Master Hopkins and Dotey came out of the cottage.
Dotey, who had an axe on his shoulder, headed
away through the garden to the hills whence firewood
was fetched, but Master Hopkins came and
stood over Ned.</p>

<p>How it went and exactly what was said, Miles
scarcely comprehended, but he heard Master Hopkins's
stern voice and Ned's sulky answering tones,
and in the lulls the rattle of trenchers, as Constance,
inside the house, cleared the breakfast table. The
gist seemed to be that Master Hopkins had found
out about Ned's threatening to break Edward
Dotey's head, for he rated him soundly that he
durst lift his voice against one set in authority
over him, a sober man, who was his better&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is not my better," Ned retorted, flinging up
his head, with his eyes sullen and angry.</p>

<p>"Do you grow saucy to contradict me?" Hopkins
asked frowningly.</p>

<p>Too much had been said of Dotey for Ned to cast
off rebuke with his usual shrug; flinging aside the
tackle, he started to his feet, but, before he could
walk away, Hopkins caught him by the shoulder.
As they stood thus Miles noted, with sudden surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
that alongside Master Hopkins Ned looked
slight and almost boyish; somehow Miles had
always thought of him as a man, because he was
old enough to use a razor.</p>

<p>"You shall stay till I have done with speaking,"
said Master Hopkins; and then Ned made a sudden
movement to free himself, flung up one arm,
half involuntarily,&mdash;and Stephen Hopkins reached
him a blow that, taking him beneath the chin,
stretched him flat on the ground at his master's feet.</p>

<p>The women came to the house-door, and it surprised
Miles that it was not Constance, but Mistress
Hopkins, who cried, in a frightened voice: "Stephen,
Stephen, I pray you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ned rose to his feet with his face white, and stood
brushing the dirt off the side on which he had
fallen; there was a great brown streak of it along one
sleeve and the shoulder of his shirt. "There's
work you have made for the mistress, sir," he said,
and began laughing in a high key.</p>

<p>"That's enough," Stephen Hopkins checked him.
"Remember, I've never laid hands on you ere now,
Edward Lister, but if you mend not your ways, this
will not be the last time." He lingered yet a moment
ere he turned away to the door, as if awaiting
an answer, but Ned made no reply, just stood fumbling
at the fishing tackle with one hand, while the
other hung limp at his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Only when Master Hopkins had passed out of
sight into the house did Lister raise his head, and
then, squaring his shoulders, he led the way toward
the street. "Will you not take the tackle, after
all?" asked Miles, running at his side. Ned's only
answer was a shake of the head, and to all Miles's
further efforts at talk and one clumsy effort at sympathy
he kept silent.</p>

<p>They left behind them the sandy street, and,
skirting along the bluff, came to the path to the
spring and the stepping-stones, beyond which lay
the trail to the ponds. Ned did not turn off there,
however, but trudged on till he reached the little
stream that flowed from the pool where they had
cut thatch. "Whither are you going?" panted
Miles, for the third time.</p>

<p>"Where you were best not come," Ned answered,
crashing into the bushes on the right hand. But
Miles turned doggedly in his steps, through the
first crisp thickets and then along the miry ground
by the edge of the pool, where the air was so muggy
that he wondered Ned cared to keep up his reckless
pace.</p>

<p>Of necessity the speed slackened, as they clambered
over the pebbles and pushed aside the crackling
undergrowth of a dry gully in the northern hillside,
but it was not till they were tramping through the
hushed woods on the summit that Ned spoke: "Did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
you know, Miley, my father was a gentleman? A
great family, the Listers, up Yorkshire way. But
he was a mere younger son, and he married a pretty
serving wench out of his father's hall, so they would
have no more of him. But he was a gentleman, and
he tried to give me a smattering of decent breeding,&mdash;"
there Ned began to laugh, with the corners
of his mouth drawn up, and his eyes mirthless,&mdash;"and
I am a brisk serving fellow, whom the master
pommels at will, eh, Miles? And they set a clod
like Edward Dotey over me."</p>

<p>There was going to be a fight, Miles guessed, but
though at another time he might have been secretly
glad at the prospect of such excitement, he had
seen one man knocked flat that day, and it had
not been amusing, so now he was not over-zealous
for the sport. "Come back and fish, Ned," he
coaxed, plucking at his companion's sleeve, when
that very moment, on the hillside below them, both
caught the sound of an axe falling on wood.</p>

<p>After that Miles scrambled down the slope, eager
as Ned himself, in his curiosity to see what would
follow. A little clearing it was they came out in,
where one tree had been newly felled, and its clean
stump showed yellow; by the tree trunk, leaning
on his axe and wiping his sweaty forehead with his
sleeve, stood Dotey.</p>

<p>"Well, Neddy, I've come to talk with you," Lister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
greeted him, in a fleering voice, and on the word
set himself down on the stump, with his hands clasped
about one knee.</p>

<p>At first it was a talking, that lay all on Ned's
side, while Dotey tried to keep up a pretense of
work. Ned spoke words, well-chosen and stinging,
that should make even stolid Dotey wince, and spoke
them in a jibing tone, with a hateful laugh that
startled Miles, even more than the sight of the little
pulsing motion of the blood in Ned's dark cheeks.</p>

<p>Dotey swung round impatiently at last. "Hold
your tongue, will you?" he cried.</p>

<p>"It is thou who wert better have held thy tongue,
Neddy, before thou wentst blabbing to Hopkins of
what passed between us."</p>

<p>"I did not," Dotey answered blankly.</p>

<p>"Thou art a liar," quoth Ned, quietly, and still
hugging his knee.</p>

<p>Then Dotey strode over to him, and Ned, laughing
up into his face, jeered at him, "threaten a man
with his fists, would he, when he had just set Hopkins
on to rebuke him for the like offense;" but
at length he rose up and cast his mocking manner.
"We are agreed there is one Edward too
many in the house," he said slowly. "Now say
we despatch one forth of it. Will you fight me
like a gentleman, rapier and dagger?"</p>

<p>In a daze Miles listened to Dotey's first protests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Ned's taunts, till the final agreement was struck and
the arrangements made. "I'll contrive to fetch
rapier and dagger from the Captain's house," Ned
concluded, "and do you, Miles, take those that
hang in Hopkins's chamber, and bring them unto
us behind the Fort Hill."</p>

<p>Unquestioningly, Miles sped upon the errand.
The sun had burnt away the fog now; among the
trees it was hot and breathless, and, when he ran
through the fields, the drying earth crumbled under
his feet. Yet he scarcely minded heat or dust, as
he thought on what was now to come, and thrilled
with anticipation; for, down in his heart, he told
himself Dotey and Lister would never hurt each
other, and he had never seen anything livelier than
a bout at quarterstaff, and a real duel would be a
wonderful thing to witness.</p>

<p>By the time he came to the house, he was all of
an excited flutter, but happily Mistress Hopkins
alone was within, and she was so busied in scouring
her pewter platters that she only looked up to ask
sharply what brought him back.</p>

<p>"Just to fetch somewhat for Ned," Miles answered
guiltily; and then fortune favored him, for
Damaris, within the bedroom, set up a wail, and
Mistress Hopkins bade him run in and soothe
her.</p>

<p>So Miles sang to baby, and, singing, took Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Hopkins's dagger from the shelf and hid it beneath
his doublet; then slipped the rapier from the
wall, and, after a hasty glance to see that none were
looking, dropped it out at the open window. Still
Damaris would not hush, and he had to pace the
floor a time, singing always, though his voice shook
with impatience, and his forehead was wet with
perspiration.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 324px;">
<img src="images/i_201.jpg" width="324" height="500" alt="swordfighting" />
<div class="caption">"Saw the two young men close in combat."</div>
</div>

<p>At last the child was quieted. Placing her on the
bed, he passed quickly out through the living room,
and, running behind the house, snatched up the
rapier from the grass. Still none saw or intercepted
him; the men and boys were at work; the
intense heat of the day kept the women within their
cottages. But to Miles each doorway seemed full
of faces, and, in a panic, he ran for the northern
spur of the hill, at a pace that brought the heart
strangling into his throat.</p>

<p>On the west side of Fort Hill was a little level
space in the abrupt descent, where some pine trees
stood wide apart, and the ground was brown and
slippery with pine needles. There Lister and Dotey,
both with their doublets and shoes cast off, were
awaiting Miles; Dotey, with his stolid face grim,
sat on the ground, turning a rapier in his hands, but
Ned Lister was pacing slowly to and fro.</p>

<p>"I came&mdash;fast as I could run," panted Miles.</p>

<p>"You saw no one?" questioned Lister, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
took Master Hopkins's rapier and measured it with
the one Dotey held.</p>

<p>"No, no one."</p>

<p>"Francis Billington has been spying about here,
though," Dotey spoke evenly. "'Twas while you
were at the Captain's house. I sent him packing.
But he may bring&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ere any come, we'll be done with the work,"
Ned Lister interrupted. "Here, Miles, do you
run up to the hilltop and lie you down in the grass.
If you see any man coming upon us, whistle us a
warning."</p>

<p>The grass, in the glare of the sun where the trees
had been felled, was a dazzling green, and the slope
was very steep. From the summit of the hill where
he lay down half-hidden, as they bade, Miles could see
the blue harbor and all the sunny street of the town,
so deserted that he ventured a glance back over his
shoulder. His eyes were fastened there, for he saw
the two young men close in combat; he heard the
click of steel, saw the quick thrust and recovery, the
bending and swaying of the struggling bodies. Then
a cry rose up in his throat and choked there, for he
saw the dagger fly out of Dotey's hand, and saw
him slip upon the pine needles.</p>

<p>A clatter of feet on hollow boards made him look
suddenly toward the gun platform, and he had an
instant's sight of Captain Standish, who, clapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
his hand to the railing of the platform, cleared it
at a leap and ran headlong down into the pine
thicket. Setting his fingers to his lips, Miles gave
a shrill whistle, and right upon it heard the Captain
cry, in a terrible voice, "What work is this?"
Casting one frightened glance down the hill, Miles
saw Ned lay on his side among the pine needles,
and Dotey stood over him with one hand dripping
blood.</p>

<p>The sky seemed to waver and the whole green
world to stagger with the horror of what had happened.
Miles crawled away through the long grass
down the hillside, through the undergrowth, and
never paused till he hid himself, terrified and sick,
in the tangle by the pool in the hollow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>A MIGHTY RESOLUTION</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE sun had dropped behind Fort Hill, and
long shadows darkened the soft sand of
the street, when Miles at last ventured into
the settlement. All the hot day he had lain hidden
by the pool and watched the shreds of cloud skim
across the deep sky and harked to the shrilling of
the locusts, while he tried not to think, yet all the
time was conscious of the awful thing that had happened,
in which he had had a hand.</div>

<p>Disjointedly, from time to time, he had planned
how he would act a part, would feign to be quite
ignorant of the duel, and be amazed when he learned
of it; but when the test came, when he found himself
actually in the street of the town, his head
whirled, and he felt that his guilt could be read in
his very face.</p>

<p>From a dooryard some one called his name,
whereat Miles's heart fairly ceased to beat; but it
was only his friend, Jack Cooke, who came running
to hang over his father's gate and speak to him:
"Ah, Miles, where ha' you been? Have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
heard talk of what happened?" There was no
time for Miles to stammer out a vague answer,
before Jack ran on: "Ned Lister and Ned Dotey,
they fought a duel, real cut and thrust, up behind
the hill, and the Captain came upon them, and
they've had them before the Governor and the
Elder, and there's been such a to-do."</p>

<p>"Had them? Then neither was killed?" Miles
cried, with a momentary feeling that nothing could
matter, if both men still lived.</p>

<p>"Nay, but Dotey has a great gash across the
palm of his hand, and Ned Lister was slashed in
the thigh so he scarce could walk. I saw 'em when
they were fetched down into the village, and they
have locked Dotey up at Master Allerton's house,
and Lister at Master Hopkins's."</p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;what are they going to do to them?" faltered
Miles.</p>

<p>"Something terrible, to be sure," Jack answered
happily; "the Captain and all are main angry.
And Goodman Billington was for flogging Francis
mightily out of hand, but the Elder said stay till
to-morrow, when they would question all further."</p>

<p>"What has Francis done?"</p>

<p>"Why, he was with them; he kept watch while
they fought. That is, one of the lads lay in the
grass and whistled them; the Captain had the least
glimpse of him; but they found Francis prowling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
on the hill, so it must ha' been he. He says 'twasn't,
but Francis is a deal of a liar, we all know."</p>

<p>Miles drew a long breath, and, turning from the
gateway, went scuffing through the sand down the
street. It was Francis, not he, whom they suspected,
he repeated, but the next moment he told
himself that it made no difference; since he was
the culprit, he must come forward and take the
blame. But when he saw Master Hopkins sitting
by the house-door, his heart choked up into his
throat, and his step faltered. After all, he would
not speak to Master Hopkins yet; his share in the
duel would be discovered soon enough.</p>

<p>With a feeling that he wished to propitiate every
one, he trudged round the house to fetch an armful
of wood, and there, by the pile, Giles was at work
with an axe. "Well, Miles?" he said, pausing in
his task, and then, as Miles came to his side, whispered
him: "Look you, father thinks you were
fishing with me all this day, that Ned sent you
back to the house to be quit of you, and that
you came home with me, but stopped at the spring.
I told him naught; he just thought so and&mdash;I let
him think so."</p>

<p>"Oh, Giles, you are right good," gulped Miles.
"For I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush now! I don't want to know aught."
And Giles went back to his chopping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>No one would find him out, then; he was safe
from the mighty beating he expected. Francis&mdash;well,
since he was innocent, of course he would say
so, and they would believe him and not punish him.
Anyway, he had no thought of confessing, Miles
assured himself hastily, as, on entering the living
room, he met Master Hopkins's stern gaze.</p>

<p>The master of the house was in a gloomy temper
that evening; a new sense of the gravity of that
day's happenings came over Miles, as he looked on
his harsh face. Mistress Hopkins, too, was silenced
completely, and the young folk did not venture
to speak while their elders did not address them,
nor had they any wish to talk, with the two empty
places at table confronting them. No word was
uttered till the meal was nearly eaten, when Mistress
Hopkins, after a swift glance at her husband, cut a
thick end from the loaf of bread, and, setting it on
a trencher, turned to Miles. "Fill a jug of water,
and carry that and the bread to Edward Lister," she
said sharply.</p>

<p>"Edward Lister may go fasting to-night," Master
Hopkins spoke, in a grim voice.</p>

<p>Miles, who had slipped from his stool, stood
shifting from one foot to the other, while he waited
to see which he should obey.</p>

<p>"Do as I bid you, Miles," Mistress Hopkins repeated
steadily, though one hand, which she rested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
on the edge of the table, clenched in nervous wise.
"The man is hurt, and whatever he has done he
shall not go hungry and thirsty. Either Miles shall
take him food and drink, Stephen, or I shall do so
myself." She rose, and, filling a jug from the
water-pail, gave it to the dubious Miles. "Take
it to him, there in the closet," she bade; so Miles,
without waiting for Master Hopkins to prevent,
stepped hastily into the little room and shut the
door behind him.</p>

<p>The closet was very narrow, very hot, and very
dusky, for the evening light came but sparsely
through the little window. Just beneath the window,
where whatever slight breeze entered the room
could be felt, the old mattress was outspread, and
on it Ned Lister lay. He had been resting his
head upon his folded doublet, but at Miles's coming
he drew himself up on his elbow; his face was
white in the dimness, and he looked limp and sick
and cowed.</p>

<p>"Here's bread and water, Ned," Miles began,
as he crossed to him. "And&mdash;and I'm mighty
sorry."</p>

<p>"I'm not," Ned answered, in a dogged tone. "I
wish only that I'd killed him. Give me a drink."
He took the jug from Miles and gulped down the
water with audible swallowings; then, when he could
drink no more, set it beside him. "They'd 'a' made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
little more tumult if I had killed him," he went on.
"But I care not what they do to me."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what do you think they will do to us,
Ned?" Miles quavered; the young man's prisoned
and unfriended state and desperate tone had dislodged
him from his last stronghold of security.</p>

<p>"They spoke of flogging us," Ned answered
hopelessly.</p>

<p>"A public flogging?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>It was only a birching Miles had looked for.
A public flogging! The horror and fright were
actual and overwhelming, for it never entered his
head that in punishment a distinction would be
made between the two principals in the duel and
their wretched little second. "Flog us!" he repeated
dazedly. "Or&mdash;or perhaps they will hang
us?"</p>

<p>"I care not if they do," Ned retorted, and, taking
up the jug, drained out the last of the water.
"Fetch me another draught, Miley, that's a good
lad," he begged. "My throat is all afire."</p>

<p>It was darker now in the living room, so none
could note the expression of his face, and Miles was
glad for that. When he filled the jug at the pail
he slopped the water clumsily, so Mistress Hopkins
chided him. He could not seem to think or even
see, for, as he stumbled back into the closet, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
bumped his forehead against the door. "Oh, Ned,"
he whispered, as he bent over the injured man again,
"they&mdash;they have accused Francis in my place,
but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, that's well," Ned spoke, as he set down
the jug. "I'm glad for't; you'll not be punished
along o' me. I'll tell no word of you, Miley, you
may be sure, and if Dotey will but hold his blabbing
tongue&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but they'll flog him; I ought to tell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let him be flogged, the imp!" Ned growled.
"But you, Miley&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was no chance to finish, for Master Hopkins,
appearing in the doorway, sternly ordered
Miles to come forth, and, when he had quitted the
closet, bolted the door.</p>

<p>By now it was too dark for a reading lesson, and,
even if it had been light, the whole routine of the
day seemed overturned. Miles wandered out into
the house-yard, but he had no will to seek the other
boys; they might talk to him of Francis. Somehow,
too, he did not wish to see Dolly or Mistress
Brewster, who had told him how his mother looked
for him to be a good lad. He went and sat down
alone on the woodpile, where he harked to the distant
frogs that were piping, and watched the stars
come out over the sea.</p>

<p>So he was still sitting when at last Constance stole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
out to him, and, putting her hand on his shoulder,
whispered him he mustn't go away and grieve so
about poor Ned. He shook her off surlily; he
was tired and sleepy, and didn't want to talk, he
said, and so rose and slouched away to his bedroom.
There it was stiflingly hot, so when he lay down
he pushed aside the coverlet, and even then he
thrashed restlessly.</p>

<p>Presently Giles came in and lay down in the other
bed that Dotey and Lister had shared; he did not
offer to talk, but, settling himself at once to sleep,
was soon breathing regularly. Miles counted each
indrawing of his breath, and tried, breathing with
him, to cheat himself into sleeping; and tried too,
with the bed beneath him scorching hot, to hold
himself quiet in one position. His face was wet
with perspiration, and his head ached. Somewhere
in the room a mosquito sang piercingly, so he must
strike about him with his hands, and still the creature
sang and the air was breathless, and he could
not sleep.</p>

<p>Then he ceased the effort to gain unconsciousness,
and deliberately set himself to face it all, and
reason it out. He had done a wicked thing, and he
should be punished for it. Francis was accused,
but Francis was innocent and must be declared so.
It did not matter though his comrades bade him
keep silent; it was one thing for Giles not to bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
tales of Miles, and another for Miles not to bear
tales of himself; and for Ned Lister's way of thinking,
it was not the way which Captain Standish
would have counselled. What would the Captain
think of him, when he knew him for a rascal who
deserved whipping, Miles wondered miserably. Yet
it was the Captain who had told him hard things
must be done, not shirked aside; and by that ruling
Miles realized that the only way for him was to let
them know it was he himself, not Francis, who had
borne a part in the duel.</p>

<p>Specious objections came, and he crushed them
down; and there came, more stubborn, the promptings
of fear. A public flogging, Ned had hinted;
and Miles recalled a dull day in the market
town, whither his father had taken him, a jeering
crowd of motley folk, a cart with a fellow laughing
on the driver's seat, and tied by the wrists to the
cart's tail, stripped to the waist, a man who kept his
head bent down and never winced, for all the great
blows the constable was laying across his shoulders.
Even now Miles turned sick at the remembrance of
the red gashes the whip had made. But Francis had
not earned such punishment, and he had earned it.</p>

<p>Miles rose from his restless bed, and stood by the
window to catch a breath of air. The moon was up
now, and a pale, hot glow lay on the fields to northward,
but not a whiff of a breeze was astir. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
harbor, as he saw it from the window, lay glassy
smooth beneath the moon. He put his weary head
down on his arms, and for a moment did not think,
only wished it were last night, when the duel was
yet unfought.</p>

<p>Then he lay down in bed, and turned and
tossed, and went his round of courage and fears
again. He was not conscious that there had been a
period of sleep; he had no sense of restfulness just
ending, only of bitter dreams, but he found the room
alight and a faint, early-morning freshness in the
air, so he knew some time had passed and it was
day.</p>

<p>He did not remember in detail the thoughts of
the night, but the conclusion was the same, and still
clearer for him to see in the glare of morning. Rising
quickly, he dressed himself so hurriedly that he
was done before sleepy Giles had pulled on his shirt;
then went out into the living room. Mistress Hopkins
was lighting her fire with flint and steel, and
Constance was stirring up porridge for the breakfast;
but he gave them no heed, for outside the
door he caught a glimpse of Master Hopkins.</p>

<p>"Why, Miles, are you ill?" Constance asked, as
she looked up at him.</p>

<p>Miles shook his head, and stepped out upon the
doorstone. At the bench alongside the door Master
Hopkins, in his shirt-sleeves, was washing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
face in a basin of water; he did not look up, but
Miles, without waiting for his notice, plunged into
the confession while his courage held. "Master
Hopkins, I want to tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it, Miles?" Hopkins asked curtly, as
he began wiping his face on the big, coarse towel.</p>

<p>"It was not Francis, sir, it was I. The duel,
you understand&mdash;" Miles's voice was faint and
quavering,&mdash;"it was not Francis."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Stephen Hopkins
then, and lowered the towel from his face; the
water-drops clung to his forehead, and his hair was
all on end, but the very grotesqueness of his look
made it the more formidable to Miles.</p>

<p>"It was not Francis," he repeated shakily, while
his trembling fingers picked at a splinter in the door-frame.
"I took the rapier out o' your bedchamber;
I was in the grass and whistled to them." He
stopped there, with his eyes on the toes of his
shoes; he did not want to look at Master Hopkins's
face, and he held his body tense against the
grasp which he expected would hale him into confinement
along with Ned Lister.</p>

<p>But instead there was a sickening silence that
seemed to last for minutes; then Master Hopkins
said slowly: "I marvel why that you, the son of a
godly man, should have a hand in all the evil
doings of the settlement. You must go tell this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
unto the Governor, so soon as breakfast is ended.
And I shall myself speak more of it to you."</p>

<p>Mechanically Miles stood aside to let Master
Hopkins pass into the house, and then he still
stood a time, gazing at the gray doorstone beneath
his feet. Presently he stepped down on the turf
and slouched round to the corner of the house,
where Trug was tied at night; though every one
thought him evil, and they were going to flog him,
Trug would still lick his hands lovingly. He untied
the dog, and, holding to one end of his strap,
went back through the yard; Constance, from the
doorway, called to him to come in to breakfast, but,
shaking his head, he walked on.</p>

<p>Outside the yard the street was quite empty, for
the colonists were all at their morning meal. Miles
trudged slowly through the sand up the hillside,
and then turned down the path to the spring, which
he judged at that hour would be deserted. Sure
enough, the only moving things beneath the high
bluff were the leaping waters of the living well,
and the sunbeams that sifted through the branches
of the encroaching alders, and sprinkled the trodden
turf.</p>

<p>Casting himself down on the margin, Miles took
a long drink of the water, that might have been
brackish and hot for any good taste he had of it,
then sat up and leaned against Trug, with one arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
about the dog's neck. He had thought, so soon
as he was thus by himself, he would cry, but he felt
all choked inside; his wickedness was too deep even
for tears.</p>

<p>Suddenly two hands were clapped over his face.
"Guess who 'tis," piped a treble voice, and, uncovering
his eyes, Miles thrust up one hand and dragged
Dolly down beside him,&mdash;a very brave Dolly, in a
clean apron, with her scarlet poppet hugged under
one arm. "I ran to the spring for Mistress Brewster,"
she explained, "but I cast away my jug when
I saw you. Why are you here, Miles?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dolly," Miles burst out, "I have been
uncommon wicked and helped fight a duel, and
they are going to flog me through the streets, and
maybe they'll hang me, and I would my mother
were here." He mastered the inclination to screw
his knuckles into his eyes, and, as he sat scowling
at the hill across the brook, and blinking bravely,
to keep a good showing before the little girl, a
mighty new idea popped into his head and made
him happy again. "But I shan't let them flog
me," he said, grandly as Ned Lister himself. "You
tell it to no one, Dolly, but I have it in mind to
run away."</p>

<p>"Whither, Miles?" the damsel asked, with interest,
but no great amazement.</p>

<p>"I shall go into the woods and live with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Indians," Miles said slowly, forming his plan as
he spoke. "They're good, pleasant folk; and I'll
build me a house of branches, and eat raspberries, and
maybe kill birds with a sling, and I'll have Trug
at night." It occurred to him that Trug would not
be the liveliest of company. "Why, Dolly, say
you come too," he cried. "We'll keep the house
together, as I thought they'd let us when father
died."</p>

<p>Dolly's face dimpled at the prospect, then grew
sober. "But if we live in the woods, Miles, we
cannot go to meeting of a Sunday, and that would
never do. Let's build our house just over the
brook&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Miles, contemptuously, "I might
as well go back and let them whip me now. I'm
going away into the forest. Will you come?" He
rose and walked manfully toward the stepping-stones,
but Dolly still sat hugging her poppet in her arms.
"If you've no wish to&mdash;" Miles said, feeling brave
and important, no longer a poor, trembling, little
culprit. Then he turned his back on her, and gave
his attention to leading Trug safely from stone to
stone across the brook.</p>

<p>But, as he gained the opposite bank, he heard a
cry behind him: "Wait, oh, wait, Miles!" Dolly,
with the poppet in her arms, came slipping and
scrambling across the stepping-stones and caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
his hand. "Love Brewster says he does not like
girls and went away to play with Harry Samson,"
she panted. "And you are the only brother I have,
Miles, and I love you, and methinks I'd liefer go
with you and be an Indian."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>IN THE SOUTHWARD COUNTRY</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>ACROSS the brook the woods spread away to
westward and to southward,&mdash;majestic oak
trees, lulling pines, pale birches, besides the
walnut and beech trees, and a host of others, the
names of which Miles did not know. Thick though
they stood in the forest, all were soundless now, and
well-nigh motionless in the still air of morning. In
all the wood the only active thing seemed the sunshine,
which came sliding through the branches to
mottle the turf or make the pine needles shiny.</div>

<p>An ardent sun it was too, even where it fell
sparsely among the trees, and beyond the thickets,
where the path led over unprotected hilltops, it beat
fiercely through the breathless air till the heat fairly
stifled the travellers. "Shall you go far before you
build your house, Miles?" panted Dolly, when the
roofs of the settlement were barely sunk from sight.</p>

<p>Miles explained that he held it best to push on
to the river where he had gone eeling, so he might
have plenty of fish in his dooryard. He thought
to make his way directly to the place, but the journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
through the heat seemed longer than when he
tramped it in the springtime, and he could not find
an easy path so adroitly as Squanto had found one.
He had to bear away inland too, lest on the seacoast
he come upon some of the colonists gathering
shellfish; and inland, not only was the going through
the undergrowth difficult, but the hills shut off the
least whiff of coolness from the sea.</p>

<p>Soon Dolly gasped for breath, Trug lolled out
his tongue, and even Miles found many pretexts
to rest. Here amid the moss bubbled a spring,
where the children delayed to drink and cool
their hands; there lay a muddy pond, covered with
white lilies, which Miles, though he wet his feet,
strove to get with a long stick; and again and yet
again they came on tangles of luscious raspberries,
where they paused to eat their fill.</p>

<p>Miles had in his pocket a fourpenny whittle, his
dearest possession, with which he stripped a great
piece of bark from a birch tree, and, cleaving two
sticks, shaped it into a basket, in which to carry
away some of the berries "against dinner-time."
But the basket proved an incumbrance to the wayfarers,
so, before they had wandered another mile,
the two children sat down in a pine grove, and ate
the berries they had gathered. They tied Trug
carefully, a needless precaution, for the old dog,
with as burdening a sense of responsibility as Miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
himself, had no thought of trotting home and leaving
those two foolish little bodies to their own protection.</p>

<p>By the position of the sun Miles judged it past
noon, when they came at last to a brook, which he
thought might be the upper waters of the stream he
was seeking. He waded in first to try its depth;
then, in gallant fashion, would have carried Dolly
over, but little mistress wished the fun of paddling
too. The alders, coming low to the brookside, cast
a rippling shadow on the water, and the sandy bottom
was firm and cool; so when both children once
had waded in, they spent some time in splashing to
and fro, while Miles set forth to Dolly how he had
caught eels.</p>

<p>The shadows were beginning to lengthen when
they climbed out on the farther side of the brook,
and passed slowly up the next hillslope. Dolly now
found she was tired, so Miles said they might as
well build their house there as anywhere. Indeed,
halfway up the slope they found a capital spot,
where the hill, drawing back on itself, left a little
level space, with sparse undergrowth and tall trees,
the vanguard of the forest higher up, that cast a
good shade.</p>

<p>To be sure, the exposure was northern, but that
would make the place cool in summer, Miles set
forth its advantages, and when winter came, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
could move round and pitch their camp on the
other side of the hill, to southward. "But I
shouldn't like to dwell in the wood when it snows,"
protested Dolly. "Let us go back and stay at
Plymouth, come winter."</p>

<p>But Miles, in his new independence, laughed at
the idea of return, and assured Dolly that he knew
how to make her a snug enough house for all
weathers. He would drive four forked stakes into
the ground; and then, from fork to fork, he would
lay four sticks; and across those, other great sticks;
and thatch all over with moss. He would drive
stakes into the ground to form the sides of the
cabin, and wattle them with elder twigs; and it
would be just the trimmest little house she ever
saw. Yes, he could drive stakes inside and divide
the space into rooms, and he would cut windows; the
only thing that troubled him was how to build the
fireplace, but he guessed he would think that out
presently.</p>

<p>About the time that the red rays of the sun
slipped under the lower branches of the trees, Miles
laid off his doublet and rolled up his shirt-sleeves,
ready for work. First, with his heel, he scored in
the dirt the lines of his house; they might as well
have a big one, he replied to Dolly's delighted
exclamations.</p>

<p>The little girl ran about within the four lines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
scored for herself the rooms which they would make.
"'Twill be such sport, Miles," she chattered. "A
keeping room we'll have, and a parlor, and a great
hall." Down she set herself on the grass, between
the wavering lines that marked the hall, and waited
for her brother to build the house over her.</p>

<p>But, though Miles strode jauntily down into the
bushes and stayed a great time, when he came back,
he bore, not an armful of stakes, but two forked
sticks, very gnarled and crooked, and another stick,
some five feet long, without a fork. "What have
you been doing, Miles?" Dolly greeted him, in a
disappointed tone.</p>

<p>"Why, the wood is hard, and my knife is not
very big," the boy answered sheepishly, "so perhaps
to-night, as 'tis drawing late, I'd best put up
just a little shelter. But I'll build the house to-morrow,
Dolly."</p>

<p>Then, because the little girl's face fell so grievously,
he made haste to amuse her by turning to
such work as he could do that evening. With a
stone for a hammer, he drove his forked sticks into
the ground, and laid the other stick across them;
that was the ridgepole, he told Dolly, and now, leaning
other boughs against it, he would make a shelter
that would be quite sufficient on so hot a night.</p>

<p>But it was wearisome work, haggling off tough
boughs with his small whittle, and he was tired with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
walking, and perhaps, he reasoned, as it was drawing
on to sunset, he were best not leave Dolly alone
by herself and go down into the dim thickets. So,
after he had cut enough branches to go a third along
one side of his ridgepole, he said vaguely that maybe
he would get some more before dark, and so sat
down close by Dolly.</p>

<p>In the west the sun had already sunk, and little
pink clouds were drifting through the sky; the
afterglow still lingered on the open land of the valley
along the stream; but in the woods, as Miles
glanced over his shoulder, the grim shadows lurked.
It was awesomely silent too, till, on a sudden, a
bird began warbling, and presently, fluttering near,
perched on a branch above the children, where he
trilled lustily.</p>

<p>Miles had some pebbles in his pocket, and, slipping
off his garter, he improvised a sling; he would
kill the bird for their supper, he told his sister, but
Dolly protested; she would rather the pretty bird
lived and sang than that she should eat him. So
the songster finished his tune and flashed away into
the darkening sky, and Miles felt as warm a glow
of self-gratulation at giving in to his sister as if he
had been quite certain of fetching down the bird
with his sling.</p>

<p>"But we've naught for our supper now, Dolly,"
he sighed presently. "To-morrow, though, I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
find my way to the shore and take us some clams,
and, in any case, we'll gather plenty of berries when
it's daylight. And you do not mind going supperless
now?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no," Dolly assented faintly; since the
twilight came on them, she had grown very quiet.</p>

<p>"I wish Ned Lister could 'a' slipped away with
us," Miles resumed. "If he were here with his
fowling piece and his fishing line, he'd take us all
the victuals we'd want. And he'd be good company,
too."</p>

<p>Then they sat in silence a time, very close to each
other, with the dog at their feet. Over in the west
the bright stars twinkled through the last waning
flecks of the sunset glow, and somewhere in the
dark the frogs were piping. "Miles," whispered
Dolly, "aren't you lonely?"</p>

<p>"To be sure not," he answered stoutly.</p>

<p>"Do you not think&mdash;perhaps we could walk
back home? I'm not weary now."</p>

<p>"I've come hither to stay," Miles said crossly;
"you can run back if you will; no one will flog
you."</p>

<p>"You know I cannot go alone," whimpered
Dolly. "And maybe there are Indians and lions
will get us. Hark!"</p>

<p>Miles sat erect and listened, every nerve tense,
but he heard only the snap of a branch, yonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
among the black trees. "It was naught, Dolly," he
said more kindly, "and you needn't fear; I can
take care of you. Come, let's lie down in our
shelter, and to-morrow in the daylight we'll build
our house."</p>

<p>They crept in behind the screen of branches slowly,
for Dolly had hold on Miles's hand and would not
let go; but at last they were settled, side by side,
Dolly next the leaning roof, and Trug close against
Miles. "The leaves tickle my nose," protested
the little girl, "and there are humps in the ground,
and I'm sure that bugs will crawl into my ears."
With a movement that quite disarranged her companions,
she sat up and tied her apron over her
head; then all three lay down once more. "It's&mdash;it's
fearsome still," Dolly whispered once, and
then no further words passed between them.</p>

<p>But, although he was silent, Miles lay long awake;
his body might be weary, but his brain was very
busy with what had befallen him in the last two
days, and with the unknown happenings that were
yet before him. When he forgot the strangeness of
the place and fell asleep at last, he dreamed of berry
patches and ponds full of lilies, and the fine, great
house he meant to build next day.</p>

<p>Somewhere sounded a bewildering crash, as if a
thousand cartloads of stone were emptied right beside
him. Miles sat up, wondering at the sound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
wondering where he was, why his face felt wet,
why Dolly clung sobbing to him. A blinding light
for an instant tore across the sky, and showed the
trees about him twisting in an awesome manner;
then darkness closed in again, and, through it,
deafened the appalling crash of thunder.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Dolly, don't be frightened,"
stammered Miles, clutching his sister; he could
feel Trug, with his whole great body a-tremble,
crowding against his knee, and, through Dolly's terrified
sobs, heard the beast whine.</p>

<p>A second flash, that seemed to rip the sky, lit up
the black woods, and, upon the roar that followed,
sounded the rush of downpouring rain. As if in
bucketsful, the water broke through the frail little
shelter; the ground beneath the children grew
sodden, and their faces tingled under the smiting of
the raindrops. "Come away, in among the trees,"
cried Miles, through the sough of the rain, and
dragged Dolly to her feet.</p>

<p>"Back to Plymouth, oh, let us go back to Plymouth,"
she wailed.</p>

<p>Without reply, Miles gripped her wrist and
stumbled up the hillside, where he remembered the
thicker growth of trees began. Bushes tore his
clothes and buffeted his dripping face; rain blinded
him; the flash of the lightning dazzled out just
long enough to show how unfriendly trunks beset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
him, then flared away and left him, half stunned by
the thunder that followed, to bruise himself against
their harsh bark.</p>

<p>Still, blinded and beaten and breathless, he fought
his way onward and at his side haled Dolly, dumb
with the bewilderment of the storm. He had forgotten
whither he hoped to go; he knew only that
there was about him a lurid darkness of overpowering
rain and rattling thunder through which he fled
away.</p>

<p>It had been several moments since the last clap
of thunder, he realized suddenly, and the rain that
yet pattered noisily among the leaves did not beat
upon him with the old fury. When the thunder
growled again, it was from far in the distance, and
the space between the flash and the crash was wider.
"'Tis near over, Dolly," he spoke subduedly.</p>

<p>The little girl fetched a tremulous, weary sob and
made a movement to drop down on the wet turf,
but Miles held her arm more firmly. "Nay, we
must keep walking till we be dry," he said, in what
he tried to make a brave voice. "Maybe we'll
come on some warm, sheltered spot," he added, for
his poor little companion's comfort.</p>

<p>Holding each other fast by the hand, and with the
dog close at their heels, they trudged forward into
the black woods. Though lessened in force, the
rain still descended in a steady drizzle, and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
bush against which they brushed drenched them
with an added shower. The ground was so slippery
and thick with mud that Miles began to fear they
had strayed into a swamp, and, when they stumbled
at last upon a thicket of close-growing evergreen, he
thought it safest to shelter there till daylight.</p>

<p>Crawling in beneath the low branches that half
protected them from the slackening rain, they cuddled
close to the dog and to each other. "I'm glad
I remembered to save my poppet," Dolly sought to
find some comfort. "She'd have been frightened,
had we left her alone."</p>

<p>So Dolly dropped off to sleep in Miles's arms,
and, lulled by the drip of the rain, he, too, dozed a
time, and awoke very chilly and stiff. The branches
above him stirred in a gusty wind, and in the mottled
sky he could see some faint stars. He crawled out
from the thicket and, as he stood up in the freer air,
caught the smell of brine in the breeze, and saw that,
in the quarter of the heavens whence it came, the
night was paling. "'Tis eastward yonder and the
sea," he cried, delighted to find, for all his wanderings,
he was not hopelessly lost. "Come, Dolly,
we'll walk to the shore."</p>

<p>Over hills and through thickets they trudged
bravely, in the exhilaration of knowing whither they
were headed, and that the dreadful night was past.
Slowly the darkness was waning; the sky faded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
black to gray, and in the wet woods a bird piped
dolefully. Presently a still more welcome sound
reached the ears of the travellers,&mdash;a long, mournful
sough as of breaking waters. "It's waves; we're
near the shore," cried Miles, and added a feeble
hurrah, whereat Trug, judging all well, leaped and
barked.</p>

<p>There was yet a wide stretch of bare uplands to
cross, and the morning had broken in earnest before
the children clambered down the low bluff to the
sandy beach. The tide was out, and the brown
rocks, like dead sea beasts, lay uncovered; but
Miles and Dolly gave them little heed, for just
then, right in their eyes, the sun burst forth in the
east, and made a path of yellow ripples on the water.</p>

<p>Forgetting her weariness, Dolly almost ran down
the hard sand to the water's edge. "I thought
maybe I could see Plymouth round that point on
our left," she told Miles disappointedly. "We
can walk thither, can we not, along the shore?"</p>

<p>"We'll eat breakfast first," said Miles, who had
found a great shell upon the sand. "I'll wade out
and dig clams, while you fetch seaweed for the fire."</p>

<p>He had not yet made up his mind about the return
to the settlement; to be sure, he was very wet
and hungry, but it did not rain every night, and with
the thought of Plymouth came the dreadful vision
of the public flogging. Besides, now it was daylight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
it was good to be his own man and get his own
breakfast; so he paddled about bravely, and did
not complain, for all the mud and water were cold
and the clams few, and his back ached with stooping
to dig them. A dozen were enough for two, he
concluded, so when he had that number disposed
securely in his doublet, which he had twisted into a
bag, he splashed shoreward.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/i_233.jpg" width="326" height="500" alt="little girl holding on to her brother, Indian in the distance" />
<div class="caption">"'Oh, Miles, 'tis the savages come for us!'"</div>
</div>

<p>Dolly had patiently fetched a mass of slippery
seaweed, and, while he drew on his shoes and stockings,
she arranged stones with the clams on top, and
the seaweed all about them.</p>

<p>"And now I'll light the fire," Miles said soberly,
as he rose up and stamped his feet in his wet shoes.
Taking a smooth stone, he knelt over the seaweed,
and, striking the stone with his whittle, sought to
get a spark. But it seemed not a proper flint, for
though he struck and struck, no spark came, and
Dolly, cold and hungry, grew impatient, whereat
Miles rebuked her sternly: "'Tis like a girl. I'm
doing the best I can. Hush, will you, Dolly?"</p>

<p>Then he forgot his petty wrangling, for, at a
growl from Trug, he looked to the bluff, and there,
between him and the safe inland forest, he saw a
little group of people coming toward him. The
look on his face made Dolly, who knelt opposite
him, glance back over her shoulder. "Oh, Miles,"
she gasped, "'tis the savages come for us!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Miles stood up and held Dolly close to him with
one arm, while he grasped Trug's collar with the
other hand. "They're all friendly, Dolly, all
friendly," he repeated, and wondered that his voice
was so dry and faint.</p>

<p>A little up the sand the Indians stopped; several
who kept to the rear were squaws, with hoes of
clam-shell and baskets, but at the front were two
warriors, who now came noiselessly down the beach.
"Quiet, Trug," Miles said, stoutly as he could,
and, as the savages drew near, greeted them boldly
with the Indian salutation he had learnt of Squanto:
"Cowompaum sin; good morrow to you."</p>

<p>They halted close to him, though evidently a
bit uncertain as to the snarling Trug; they spoke,
but he could make out no word of their rapid
utterance. "I'm a friend," he repeated, hopeless of
getting any good of his little store of Indian words,
almost too alarmed even to recall them. "I come
from Plymouth,&mdash;" he pointed up the shore where
the settlement lay,&mdash;"and I want to go back thither."</p>

<p>He made a movement as if to start up the shore,
when one of the Indians laid a hand on his arm and
pointed southward. Miles shook his head, while
dumb terror griped his heart; these were none of
King Massasoit's friendly Indians, but people from
the Cape, such as had fought the Englishmen in the
winter. "Let me go home," he repeated unsteadily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>But without heeding him one loosed his arm from
about Dolly's waist. Thereat Trug, with his hair
a-bristle, gathered himself to spring, and the other
warrior gripped the club he carried in his hand.
"You shan't kill my dog!" screamed Miles, seizing
Trug's collar to hold him back; and at that the
savage, taking Dolly from beside him, lifted her in
his arms.</p>

<p>The other Indian would have picked up Miles,
but he dodged his hand, and, dragging Trug with
him, ran up alongside the warrior who held Dolly.
The little girl lay perfectly quiet, her eyes round
with terror, and her lips trembling. "Don't be
afraid, Dolly," quavered Miles, in what he tried to
make a stout voice, "no matter where they take us.
They shan't hurt you; Trug and I won't let them
hurt you."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT does not become an Englishman to make a
weak showing before unclad savages; so presently
Miles swallowed the sob that was fighting
a way up his throat, mastered the other shaky signs
of his terror, and put his whole attention to keeping
pace with his captors. They were now well in
among the trees, where the undergrowth, after the
Indian custom, had been thinned by fire, so between
the great blackened trunks opened wide vistas, as in
an English park.</div>

<p>To Miles each open glade looked like every
other one, but the Indians found amid the trees a
distinct trail along which they hastened, single file,
with the tall warrior who bore Dolly in the lead.
Miles kept persistently at his heels, though the
breath was short in his throat, and his whole body
reeked with perspiration. The sun, all unobscured
and yellow, was climbing steadily upward, and, by
the fact that it shone on the left hand, he knew that
they were going southward ever, southward into the
hostile country.</p>

<p>About mid-morning they descended a sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
slope, where pine trees grew, to a brook with a
white bottom. Miles gathered his strength, and,
making a little spurt ahead, flung himself down by
the stream to drink; he felt cooler for the draught,
but, when he dragged himself to his feet, he found
that, after his little rest, his tired legs ached the
more unbearably, so he made no objection when the
Indian with the club, lifting him unceremoniously
to his back, carried him dry-shod through the brook.</p>

<p>Even on the other side, Miles made no struggle
to get down; it would be useless, he judged, and
then he was too worn out to tramp farther at such
speed. He settled himself comfortably against his
bearer's naked shoulders, and offered not half so
much protest as Trug, who, trotting at the Indian's
side, now and again looked to his master and whined
anxiously.</p>

<p>As soon as he was a bit rested, Miles began to
take closer note of the country through which they
were passing,&mdash;a country of spicy pine thickets
and of white dust, that powdered beneath the feet
of the Indians. From his lofty perch he could pluck
tufts of glossy pine needles as they brushed under
the lower branches of the trees, and, hungry as he
was, he did not find them ill to chew. Presently
he tried to converse with his Indian. "Tonokete
naum?" he questioned. "Whither go you?"</p>

<p>The savage answered in a pithy phrase, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Miles made out only the word Ma-no-met. That,
he had a vague remembrance of hearing the men say,
was a place somewhere to the southward; but, at
least, it was not Nauset, where the Indians who had
fought the English lived. In quite a cheerful tone,
Miles called out to Dolly their destination, and,
with something of his former confidence, set himself
to watch for the town; he could not help imagining
it would be a row of log cabins in a clearing,
just like Plymouth.</p>

<p>But, for what to him seemed long hours, he saw
no sign of a house, just the monotonous sheen of
the pine trees where the sun struck upon them,
and the dust that burst whitely through its sprinkling
of pine needles. Now and again, through the
branches, he caught the glimmer of sunny water,
where some little pond lay; and once, when the
trail led down into a hollow, sand gave place to
the clogging mire of a bog, and the scrub pines
yielded to cedars.</p>

<p>The slope beyond, with its pines thickening in
again, was like all the rest of the wood, so like that
Miles had suffered his eyes to close against the
weary glare and the hot dust, when a sudden note
of shrill calling made him fling up his head. They
were just breasting the ridge that had been before
them, and the trees, dwindling down, gave a sight
of what lay at the farther side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Unbroken sunlight, Miles was first aware of,&mdash;sunlight
dazzling from the hot sky, beating upward
from blue water, glaring on green pines that spread
away beyond; and then, as the dissonant calls that
made his whole body quiver drew his eyes to the
right, he saw in the stretch of meadow-land between
the creek and the ridge a squalid group of unkempt
bark wigwams. The smoke that curled upward
from their cone-like summits seemed to waver in
the heat, and for an instant Miles blinked stupidly
at the smoke, because he dared not look lower
where he must see the varied company of coppery
people who were flocking noisily forth from their
shelters.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, as if starting from a bad dream, he
writhed out of his captor's hold and dropped to his
feet in the sand. The Indian's grasp tightened
instantly on his arm; but in any case, whatever
they meant to do to him, even to kill him, it was
better to walk into Manomet than to be carried
thither like a little child. Where there might be
other lads, too, it went through Miles's head, even
in the midst of his sick fear.</p>

<p>Other boys there were, certainly, squaws and
warriors too, all thronging jabbering round him, so
that, with a poor hope that he at least might prove
friendly, Miles clung tight to the hand of the Indian
who had carried him. Wolfish yelp of dogs, shrill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
frightened cries of children, clatter of the curious
squaws,&mdash;all deafened and bewildered him. Close
about him he beheld crowding figures,&mdash;bare bodies
that gleamed in the sunlight, swarthy, grim faces,
eyes alert with curiosity,&mdash;and, overarching them
all, the hot, blue sky that blinded him.</p>

<p>Along with their Indian masters ran dogs, prick-eared,
fox-like curs, one of which suddenly darted
upon Trug. Above the chatter of the curious folk
Miles heard the currish yelp, the answering snarl;
but ere he could cry out or move, the old civilized
mastiff caught the savage cur by the scruff, and,
shaking the life out of his mangy body, flung him
on the sand.</p>

<p>Miles let go the Indian's hand, and cast himself
upon his dog, while his mind rushed back to
a dreadful day in England, when Trug had slain a
farmer's tike, whose owner had threatened to brain
"the curst brute"; people did not like to have your
dog kill their dog, Miles remembered with terror;
so, catching Trug by the collar, he buffeted his head,
a punishment which the old fellow, with his tushes
still gleaming, endured meekly.</p>

<p>The Indians, who had been pressing round him,
had shrunk back a little, Miles perceived, as he
paused for breath; they could not be used to big
mastiffs. "The dog will not worry you," he addressed
the company in a propitiating voice. "That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
is, he won't worry you unless you harm Dolly and
me."</p>

<p>They could not understand his words, he realized,
but they could understand gestures, so with a bold
front he gripped Trug's collar, and urged the old
dog, still grumbling, along with him. He walked
bravely too, with his chin high and his neck stiff, for
all there was a fluttering sensation up and down his
legs. He was not afraid, he assured himself, while
he pressed his hand upon Trug's warm neck for
comfort, and fixed his eyes on the tall warrior striding
before him who still bore Dolly.</p>

<p>Suddenly Miles perceived the press about him to
give way a little, and out from amidst the people an
old man came gravely toward him. He was a tall
old man, with a wrinkly face, and his dress was
squalid and scanty as that of the others, but by the
many beads of white bone that hung on his bare
breast, Miles judged him to be the chief of Manomet,
Canacum. So he made his most civil bow, though
he could not keep his knees from trembling a bit;
but he looked up courageously into the old Indian's
face, and, as he did not speak first, at length politely
bade him "Cowompaum sin."</p>

<p>He could not understand&mdash;indeed, apprehensive
as he was, he scarcely had the wit to try to
understand&mdash;what was said to him in reply, but
he knew the old man took him by the hand, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in tremulous obedience he went whither he was
led.</p>

<p>The blue sky was all blurred out, as he passed
through the opening of one of the black wigwams;
an intolerable smoky odor half choked him; and his
eyes were blinded with the dimness all about him.
But out of the dusk he heard Dolly call his name,
and, stumbling toward the sound, he put his arms
about his sister.</p>

<p>As he grew more accustomed to the dim light,
he saw the old Chief, squatting on a mat at the
back of the wigwam, and saw the shadowy gesture
that bade him sit beside him. Almost cheerfully,
since he held Dolly's hand in his, Miles obeyed;
and for the moment, as Trug stretched himself at
his feet, and Dolly snuggled close to his side, felt
secure and whispered his sister not to fear.</p>

<p>There was no time to say more, for, amidst the
confusion of folk that crowded the dusky wigwam,
he now made out two squaws, who drew near, and,
with their curious eyes fixed on him, set before him
food&mdash;a kind of bread of the pounded maize and
ears of young corn roasted.</p>

<p>It did not need the Chief's gesture to bid Miles
fall to; he might be more than a little frightened,
but he was also very hungry, for it was near eight-and-forty
hours since he had tasted heartier food
than raspberries. He now ate with such good will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that nothing was left of the victuals but the corn-cobs,
and he persuaded Dolly to eat too, though it
was hard work to coax the child to lift her head from
his shoulder. "I do not like to look on the Indians,"
she murmured tearfully, between two hungry
mouthfuls of corn. "I would they did not so stare
at us."</p>

<p>They were not over-civil, Miles thought, though,
after all, they scarcely stared at their white guests
more rudely than Miles himself had gazed at Massasoit,
when the latter visited Plymouth. He might
not have minded their staring, if there had not been
so many of them,&mdash;squatting and lying all through
the wigwam, on the floor, or on the mats, or on a
broad, shelf-like couch which ran all about the
lodge,&mdash;and if the bolder ones had not been curious
to feel of his shirt,&mdash;his doublet was left behind
on the beach where he had taken the clams,&mdash;and
of his shoes, and of Dolly's gown, though no
one cared to put a hand upon the bristling and
growling Trug.</p>

<p>They chattered a wearisome deal too, till Miles's
head ached with the clamor, the squaws very shrilly,
and the men in guttural tones; the old Chief seemed
to be questioning the Indians who had found the
children on the beach, but presently he turned and
addressed Miles.</p>

<p>The boy fixed his eyes on the speaker's face and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
tried to understand, but, while all things about him
were so strange and ominous, it was hard to keep
his thoughts on the hasty sounds. He did make
out that the Chief asked him whence he came, and,
answering "Patuxet," he pointed whither he judged
the Plymouth plantation lay. "I should like to go
back thither," he suggested, and endeavored, with
signs and his few poor words of the Indian language,
to explain that, if they took Dolly to the
settlement, the people would give them knives and
beads. He started to make the same arrangement
for himself, but he judged it useless; he doubted if
Master Hopkins would think him worth buying
back.</p>

<p>But, even in Dolly's case, no one made a movement
to grant Miles's request, and though the old
Chief spoke, for an Indian, at some length and in a
civil tone, he did not mention Patuxet nor a return
thither. Miles swallowed down a lump in his throat,
and said bravely to Dolly that he guessed they'd
have to spend the night with the savages, but they
seemed kindly intentioned.</p>

<p>Through the low opening that formed the door
of the wigwam he could see now that a long, gray
shadow from the pine ridge lay upon the trodden
sand; the afternoon must be wearing to a close.
Moment by moment he watched the shadow stretch
itself out, till all was shadow and a thicker dimness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
filled the wigwam, and on the bit of sky, which
he could see through the smoke-hole in the roof,
brooded a purplish shade. It was evening in
earnest, and it should be supper time, Miles told
Dolly; but Dolly, resting half-asleep against his
arm, made no answer.</p>

<p>Miles himself, for all his apprehensions, was
heavy with the weariness of the last two days, so,
whatever the morrow might have in store, he was
glad when, one by one, the Indians slipped away
like shadows, and he judged it bedtime. He and
his sister were to sleep on the couch-like structure
by the wall, he interpreted the Chief's gestures, so
willingly he bade Dolly and Trug lie down; then
stretched himself beside them. A comfortable resting
place it was, very springy and soft with skins;
but, ere Miles could reassure Dolly and settle himself
for the night, Trug began to growl, and the
great couch to groan, as what seemed an endless
family of Indians cast themselves down alongside
them.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish I were home in my own bed,"
Dolly protested, with a stifled sob.</p>

<p>Miles hushed her, in some alarm lest the savages
might not approve of people who cried; but his
Indian bedfellows never heeded Dolly's tears, for
they were lulling themselves to sleep by singing in
a high, monotonous strain that drowned every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
other noise. After the little girl was quieted, they
still droned on, and, when they were at last silent,
there sounded the notes of swarms of mosquitoes
that tortured Miles, for all he was so tired, into
semi-wakefulness.</p>

<p>A snatch of feverish slumber once and again,
and then, of a sudden, he was aware of the round
moon peering in at him through the smoke-hole.
That same light would now be whitening the quiet
fields of Plymouth, and slipping through the little
windows across the clean floor of Master Hopkins's
living room; Miles remembered just how the patch
of light rested on the wall of his own chamber.</p>

<p>He sat up on his comfortless bed and hid his
face against his knee. "I wish I hadn't run away;
I wish I were home&mdash;were home," he groaned aloud.
But, save for the heavy snoring of the Chief of
Manomet and his warriors, he got no answer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>HOW THEY KEPT THE SABBATH</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>A LITTLE daylight works a mighty change
in the look of things. When in the morning
Miles rose at length from the stupor of
sleep into which he had fallen, the sky was clouded
filmily to westward, but in the east, above the pines,
hung a yellow sun. The river that curved through
the meadow was half bright with the stroke of the
sun, and, where the trees of the opposite bank grew
low, half a lucid green; the strip of sandy beach
shone white, and the coarse herbage of the level
space all was gleaming.</div>

<p>Miles looked forth from the doorway of Chief
Canacum's wigwam, and, sniffing the breeze with the
tang of brine in it, decided that, after all, Manomet
might prove a pleasant place in which to spend a
day. He said as much to Dolly, but she held her
poppet closer and shook her head. "There were
fleas in that bed," she answered sorrowfully. "Let's
go home now, Miles."</p>

<p>An easy thing to say, but to do it would have
puzzled an older head than Miles's, for not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
did leagues of forest stretch between him and the
English settlement, but, even had he known the
direct road to Plymouth, there was no chance to
follow it, since, wherever he turned, the watchful
eyes of the savages were upon him.</p>

<p>Now the first novelty had worn off, the warriors
limited themselves to staring at their visitors as they
sauntered through the camp, but the squaws and
children still wished to press close, and feel their
clothes and touch their hands. However, no one
meant to harm him, Miles decided, though he only
half realized how awe of their white faces and strange
garments and of their great, ugly dog was protecting
him and his sister; and, having once concluded
he was to be left unhurt, he took pleasure in being
a centre of interest; it was his first experience of
this sort in all his much-snubbed life.</p>

<p>So, though Dolly would scarce look on the dark
people about them, Miles sought presently to talk
to them, just as he tried to talk to the Indians who
came to Plymouth. So well did he impress it upon
them that he wanted his breakfast, that one of the
squaws, who had bright eyes, though her face was
very dirty, led the children into her wigwam, where
she brought them food,&mdash;roasted crab fish and
bread. Miles thanked her and ate, and bade Trug
and Dolly eat too, while the little Indians and the
squaws, squatting in the sand about the wigwam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
door, watched as if they had never before seen two
hungry children.</p>

<p>Presently, as he wished to divide a morsel with
Dolly, Miles drew out his whittle, whereat the onlookers
crowded closer to gaze. Miles showed them
his knife, though he took care not to let it go out
of his hands, and he exhibited the other treasures
he carried in his breeches pockets,&mdash;several nails,
a button or two, some beads, and an English farthing
piece. Indians always looked for presents, he
knew, so, before he went out of the wigwam, he gave
a button to the squaw who had fed him.</p>

<p>With his Indian followers eying him the more
admiringly, he now went journeying through the
warm sand, past the dingy bark houses, to the farther
verge of the camp, where, beyond a lusty patch
of rank weeds, the corn-field of the savages shimmered
in the heat. The tillage of the Indians
seemed to him of an untidy sort; they had cleared
away the trees with fire, never troubling to dig up
the roots, so blackened stumps dotted the field, and
here and there lay the greater bulk of a charred and
fallen trunk. In between, the green corn straggled
up, and several squaws were tending it with hoes
made of great clam-shells. They cast aside their
tools to stare on Miles and Dolly, but Miles stared
in return only a short space; he had seen corn-fields
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only to think, Dolly," he burst out, as he
turned his back on the hoers, "there's no one to
bid me weed or fetch water or aught else that displeases
me. After all, 'tis a merry life the Indians
lead; I'm willing to dwell here with them."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> do not wish to be a dirty Indian," Dolly answered
decidedly, but in a whisper, as if she thought
these attentive people must be able to understand
her words. "Do you not think the men from
Plymouth will come to seek us soon and take us
home?"</p>

<p>"I do not want them to come," Miles replied
calmly. "Maybe they would hang me for that
Ned fought in the duel, and surely they would beat
me for running away. I shall have to stay here
always," he added cheerfully.</p>

<p>At this Dolly's lips quivered, but Miles, intent
now on an Indian lad with a little bow in his hand,
who had just come near, gave his sister no heed.
"I'm minded to ask that boy to let me play with
his bow," he spoke out, as they arrived once more
within the lee of Chief Canacum's wigwam. "You
sit here, and Trug shall watch you."</p>

<p>A protest or two from Dolly, after the unreasonable
fashion of women-folk, but Miles, leaving her
seated on the sand, walked away to the coppery lad
he had singled out. For a time the two boys stared
at each other gravely, then Miles, smiling affably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
touched the bow, saying, "Cossaquot? Nenmia,"
till presently the other yielded it into his hands.</p>

<p>Then they strolled away, with several other beady-eyed
youngsters, into the weeds on the outskirts of
the camp, where Miles tried his skill at shooting.
Though in England he had often handled a bow,
here the best showing he could make set the little
Indians laughing; and when the owner of the bow,
taking it from him, shot an arrow and fetched down
a pine cone from a tree many feet distant, Miles understood
their merriment at his awkwardness.</p>

<p>But then he stepped up to a young sumach, and,
pulling out his whittle, hacked off a small branch in
a manner to make his new friends marvel; so, each
party respectful of the other's arts, they were speedily
on a sound enough footing to race away together
to the river bank.</p>

<p>On the shore, half in water and half on land, lay
three Indian boats, light, tricky things, all built of
birch bark. Miles had never seen such craft, so he
set to examining them, but his new comrades splashed
into the water. On the sunny beach it was hot, but
across the stream, whither they swam, the trees that
pressed close to the margin darkened the shallows
with a deep green, so cool and tempting that Miles,
dusty with travel, longed to bathe in it too.</p>

<p>In the end he flung off his clothes, and prepared
to join in the splashing, when his Indian acquaintances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
paddled shoreward to study his garments.
Miles suffered the youngster who had lent him the
bow to try on his shoes, whereat all grew so clamorous
he feared a little lest his wardrobe disappear
among them, for he remembered how Thievish Harbor
took its first name from the pilfering habits of
the Indians. Fortunately Trug, forsaking Dolly,
arrived just then, and when he stretched his great
bulk on his master's clothes, none cared to disturb
them.</p>

<p>With his mind set at rest, Miles plunged into the
tepid water, where he frolicked about with his new
comrades, who swam like dogs, paw over paw, and
dived in a way that bewildered him. But speedily
he was doing his share in the ducking and splashing
and whooping, till, before he knew it, the afternoon
was half spent, and his shoulders smarted with the
burning of the sun.</p>

<p>The little Indians followed him, when he spattered
out of the river, and, with no more than a
shaking of their ears, like puppies, were ready to run
about, but Miles, as a penalty of civilization, had to
stay to drag on his clothes. He felt chilly now, he
found, and hungry too, and he guessed he and Trug
were best go seek Dolly.</p>

<p>But when he came into the lee of Chief Canacum's
wigwam, he saw there just scuffled, empty sand, so,
with a big fright laying hold on him, he ran out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the straggling street and called his sister's name
aloud. Just then Trug's bark told him all was
well, and, hastening after the dog, he found, in the
shade of a distant wigwam, a squaw weaving a mat
of flags, some children sprawling, and Dolly herself,
who was eating raspberries from a birch bark basket.
"Why did you run away and frighten me?" Miles
demanded crossly, as he flung himself on the ground
beside her.</p>

<p>"I may go away and make friends as well as
thou," Dolly answered loftily. "But you shall
have some of my berries, Miles. They fetched me
them, and I can eat these&mdash;" her voice sank&mdash;"because
they must be clean. But their other victuals
are not, I know. I watched, and the women do
never wash their kettles."</p>

<p>Miles had no such scruples of cleanliness, so
when, some two hours later, he scented the odor
of cooking, he rose eagerly and, thinking on supper,
sought Canacum's wigwam. There were four
dark boats upon the white beach now, he saw, so
he judged that a fishing party had come in.</p>

<p>When he passed through the low door into the
wigwam, he found a fire alight and a great pot of
clay hung on small sticks that were laid over it.
Into the pot the drudging squaws were putting fresh
fish, and acorns, and the meat of squirrels, and
kernels of corn, and whatever else they had of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
edibles,&mdash;"a loathsome mash," Dolly whispered
Miles, but he was so hungry that it did not take
away his appetite.</p>

<p>So soon as the broth was done, near half the village
squatted round the pot, the men in an inner
circle, while on the outskirts, eager for any morsel
their masters might fling to them, waited the poor
squaws. But Dolly, because she was a little white
squaw, was suffered to sit down with her brother beside
the old Chief, who scooped up pieces of the fish
and hot broth in a wooden bowl and gave it to Miles.</p>

<p>Dolly looked askance at the food, but Miles and
Trug ate ravenously; neither his queer table mates
nor their queer table manners troubled the boy,
since he himself was licking his fingers and wiping
them on Trug's fur contentedly. "I like to eat
with my fingers," he chattered to his venerable
host. "At home they make me to eat tidily with
a napkin, but I like it better thus."</p>

<p>But, even at his hungriest, he could not match
the Indians in trencher work; for, long after Miles
had done eating and lain back against Trug, the
savages still champed on, till nothing but scattered
bones was left of the fare. By then the sun was
quite down, so the lodge was black, save for the
flashes of the sinking fire. Out-of-doors an owl
hooted, and speedily the Indian guests withdrew to
their own lodges, and the Chief's household went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to their common bed. Little comfort did Miles
and his two companions find there, for the singing
Indians and the mosquitoes pestered them as on
the preceding night.</p>

<p>"I'll not endure this a third time," Miles fretted,
when he awoke in the chilly morning. "Look
you, Dolly, why should I not build us a little wigwam?
I make no doubt they'll suffer us go sleep
there by ourselves."</p>

<p>Full of this new plan, he bustled forth from the
wigwam, but outside the doorway halted in surprise.
He could see no river nor more than the tips of the
pines for a thick white fog that drifted through
the village and struck rawly to his very marrow.
For a moment he had a mind to slip back to
Dolly in the close wigwam, but, spying his Indian
allies, he kept to his first manly resolve and began
chatting to them of his intentions. Though they
could understand nothing of his talk, they came with
him readily, through the clammy fog, out beyond
the camp, where the sand, sloping up to the pine
ridge, offered, as Miles remembered, a good location
for a wigwam.</p>

<p>The Indian houses, so far as he could judge, were
built by bending over young saplings and securing
both ends in the ground, then covering the frame
with mats or great pieces of bark. Miles decided
that poles, bound together at the top, would serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
him as well, so he went to cut them in a growth of
young oaks at some distance from the camp. The
trees, all laden with fog moisture, drenched him as
he worked, and the task took him a long time with
his small whittle,&mdash;would have taken him longer,
had not the Indian boys helped him to break the
poles.</p>

<p>They were all intent on his proceedings, and,
when he returned to the site he had chosen, settled
themselves in the sand to watch him, an action
which pleased him little. For, when he stuck his
poles into the sand, at the circumference of a rough
circle, and bent them all together at the top, the
ends that were thrust into the sand would fly up,
and 'twas annoying to have other people see his
failure. It took him some minutes to make all
secure, and by then he was so breathless and tired
that he was glad to run tell Dolly of his progress,
and, at the same time, rest a bit.</p>

<p>Spite of the fog, he found his sister had come out
from the choking atmosphere of the wigwam. She
was sitting a little up the pine ridge, behind the
lodges, on a fallen tree trunk that was all a-drip;
the sand, too, Miles noted, when he lay down at her
feet, was damp and sticky to the touch.</p>

<p>"They have left us alone, haven't they, Dolly?"
he said in some surprise, as he glanced about him
and saw no Indians near. "But Trug, he has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
followed; very like they think we'll not run away
and leave him behind." Then he perceived that
his sister's arms were empty. "Where's the old
red poppet?" he cried.</p>

<p>"My poppet Priscilla," Dolly replied seriously.
"I did put her away carefully. For 'tis the Sabbath
to-day, Miles."</p>

<p>"Is it?" the boy questioned, with some misgivings.
"I'd lost count of the days. Why, I have
been cutting poles and begun my wigwam&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you are a Sabbath-breaker," Dolly said
relentlessly. "If you be so wicked, I doubt if ever
God let us go back to Plymouth. And I've been
praying Him earnestly. Miles, have you said your
prayers o' nights?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no," the boy faltered, "last night I forgot
'em, and night before I was weary."</p>

<p>"Come, we'll say them now," Dolly announced,
and fell on her knees in the wet sand.</p>

<p>Miles obediently knelt beside her; his father
had looked somewhat askance at this practice, but
Miles's mother had first taught the children to say
their evening prayer on their knees, and, for her
sake, the boy held obstinately to that usage.</p>

<p>The thought of her came clearly to him now, and
how she had bidden him be good to Dolly, so, when
he had prayed "Our Father," he added an extemporaneous
appeal, that the English folk might soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
come in search of them. "Not for my sake, O
Lord," he explained carefully, "but Thou knowest
Dolly is but a wench and were better at Plymouth,
perhaps. And, O Lord, I'd near be willing to go
thither myself, if Thou wouldst put it in their
minds not to flog me."</p>

<p>Indeed, as he prayed, his heart grew very tender
toward the tiny settlement; he would have liked
well to open his eyes and see the sandy street of
the little village stretching away up the hillside, the
ordered cottages, the grave men about their tasks,
even Master Hopkins&mdash;perhaps.</p>

<p>Rather subdued, he set himself by Dolly on the
wet log. "Now I'll tell you somewhat out of the
Bible, since there is no one to preach us a discourse,"
he said, and set forth to her what he remembered
of the last portion of the Scriptures
which Master Hopkins had made him read. It
was all about how Moses let loose the plagues upon
the wicked king of Egypt, flies and boils and frogs,&mdash;Miles
was not quite sure of the order of events,
but he detailed them with much gusto.</p>

<p>"I do not think there is a great deal of doctrine
therein," Dolly commented, with a mournful shake
of the head. "Elder Brewster, he did not discourse
thus; and Mistress Brewster and Priscilla and the
boys will have bread for dinner to-day, and maybe
butter, and lobster, and, if I were home, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
sleep in my own bed with Priscilla, and put on a
clean gown in the morning. I wish I were home
now."</p>

<p>Miles squeezed Dolly's fingers, and sat staring
away from her into the fleecy fog that still shivered
through the camp. So intent was he on gulping
down his home-sickness that he started in surprise
when a hand was laid on his shoulder, and he looked
up into the face of one of Canacum's warriors.</p>

<p>He was to come to the Chief's wigwam, he interpreted
the Indian's signs, so he rose and, leading
Dolly, followed his guide down the sandy slope.
"Maybe 'tis that they have meetings too on the
Sabbath," Dolly whispered him.</p>

<p>Inside the lodge, where a fire smoked, many
warriors were gathered, true enough, but no one
preached to them. Instead all puffed at their
pipes and, with long pauses, spoke together, till
Miles, sitting with Dolly by the Chief, grew weary.
Understanding nothing of their talk, he thought on
his new wigwam and scarcely heeded them, till a
warrior, whom he had a vague idea he had not seen
before about the camp, rose up and, coming to him,
lifted him to his feet.</p>

<p>"What will you do?" Miles cried, with a quick
pang of fright as he found his arm fast in the other's
grip. "Are we to go with you?" And then, with
a sudden, overwhelming hope, "To Patuxet?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nauset," grunted the imperturbable Chief.</p>

<p>"They set upon the English there!" gasped
Miles. "I will not go, I will not!"</p>

<p>After that, all passed so quickly he remembered
nothing clearly, just the confusion of bronzed figures
in the smoky lodge, the choking odor of the
fire, the sight of Dolly's blanched face, as one of
the Indians drew her back from him. He had a
scattered remembrance of crying out that they
should not dare take his sister from him, Captain
Standish would punish them for it; and then of
a helpless, childish struggle, wherein he kicked
and struck unavailingly at the savage who held
him.</p>

<p>The chill fog stung against his face, as he was
dragged forth from the wigwam. He seemed to
come to his senses again, and, ceasing to struggle,
called over his shoulder to Dolly not to be afraid,
no one would dare hurt her. Something pressed
feebly against his knees, and he looked down at
Trug, with a broken thong hanging at his neck
and his head bleeding. He caught the old dog by
the collar. "Go in unto Dolly, sirrah," he bade
in his sternest voice. "And guard her, guard
her!"</p>

<p>He had a last glimpse of his sister, crouching in
the door of the wigwam, with her arms clasped
close about the mastiff's neck and her frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
eyes fixed on him. Then the grasp on his wrist
tightened, and stumblingly he followed along with
his new captors, past the dripping wigwams with
their staring people, past his own unfinished lodge,
and into the chill silence of the moist woods.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>AT NAUSET VILLAGE</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>EASTWARD of Nauset, unchecked by headlands,
as was Plymouth Harbor, but sweeping
away into the very sky line, lay the
ocean. The tide was now rolling in; far out at sea
the water all was ridged, and, as the waves pressed
shoreward, their crests, heaving up, burst into white
foam. With each inward swell the water crept
nearer, till now it reached the bare rock where Miles
Rigdale, his knees level with his chin and his arms
cast round them, was perched.</div>

<p>Overhead, Miles knew the sky was bright, and
the dazzle of the water was ever present to his eyes.
He strove to think on naught but the barren glare
before him, yet beneath, in his heart, he was conscious
all the time of an aching weight of misery
and sick fear. For this was Nauset; he had but to
turn his head, and, far up the sandy beach, where
the storm-swept pines began, he could see the
cluster of wigwams, and, nearer, squatting upon the
shore, the stolid Indian folk who had dogged him
thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Only that morning he had reached Nauset.
There had been more than four and twenty hours
of journeying, through unknown villages, and by
sea in a frail bark canoe, the pitching of which,
under the stroke of the waves, had frightened him
sorely. All, indeed, had been fright and confusion
and the wearying effort to hide his terror. For the
Indians of Manomet doubtless would beat Trug
over the head again till he was dead, and they would
send Dolly far away, as they had sent him, perhaps
do worse. Miles buried his face against his knees,
and bit his lips hard.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, he was lifted bodily from the rock
where he sat. The white water eddied all round it,
he noted, and the warrior who held him had stepped
through it to fetch him ashore. For a moment
after he was set upon his feet, he stood staring out
upon the dazzling sea, then turned and passed
slowly up the sand, through a patch of sparse beach
grass, to the village.</p>

<p>Slowly though he loitered, he came at last to the
sunny cluster of wigwams; in their scant shadow the
men&mdash;the warriors of Nauset, and those who had
fetched Miles hither&mdash;lay smoking, and, liking
their surly looks little, he stepped presently into the
Chief's great wigwam, where the squaws were cooking.</p>

<p>He was hungry, for he had not eaten since last
evening, so he stood waiting and watching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
women, though he no longer sought to talk to
them. For they did not show a friendly curiosity,
such as the squaws at Manomet had shown, but
rather scowled upon him, as if they already knew
enough of white folk. It was from this place that
the trader Hunt, who stole Squanto, had kidnapped
seven Indians, and it was here&mdash;Miles remembered
only too clearly every scrap of his elders'
tales&mdash;that only the last summer, in revenge for
Hunt's dealings, three Englishmen trading thither
had been slain.</p>

<p>So the heart within him was heavy indeed, when
at length he set himself down amongst the warriors
at the noon meal. His place was next the chief of
the village, whom men called Aspinet, just as it
had been at every village where he had sat to eat,
but this chieftain was not friendly, as the others
had seemed. What few gutturals he uttered were
directed to his warriors, not to Miles, nor did he
offer to give the boy food.</p>

<p>Of necessity, Miles imitated the others by thrusting
his hands into the kettle and laying hold on the
great claw of a lobster; it was so hot it burned his
fingers sharply, but, mindful that he was watched,
he held it fast till he could lay it on the trampled
sand at his side. His fingers smarted, and he
dared not raise his eyes from the lobster, lest the
tears of pain that were gathering in them be seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Fumblingly he drew forth his whittle and was making
a clumsy effort to dig the meat from the shell,
when a dusky hand suddenly closed on his wrist,
and the whittle was wrenched from his grasp.</p>

<p>For one nightmare-like instant the world seemed
struck from under him; then Miles was aware of
the reality of the smoky walls of the wigwam and
of those grim-faced savages who sat round him.
He stood up slowly, with his knees a-tremble, but
he thrust out his hand bravely, and, in a stout voice,
spoke to Chief Aspinet: "That whittle is mine.
Give it back to me."</p>

<p>A moment he stood fronting the Chief and his
warriors, then, with a sudden feeling that for sheer
alarm he would presently burst out crying, he turned
and walked slowly from the circle of the feasters.
"I shall not eat of your food nor come into your
house till you give back my whittle," he flung over
his shoulder in a quavering voice.</p>

<p>With that he passed out at the doorway and set
himself down cross-legged in the deep sand in the
lee of the wigwam. The sun of early afternoon
poured scorchingly upon him, and the sand, as he
sifted it between his fingers, was warm. Out above
the ocean he could see a great white gull that flashed
in the strong light.</p>

<p>A little shadow from the wigwam fell upon him,
and bit by bit broadened, while he stupidly watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the strip of dark advance across the white sand. It
must be mid-afternoon, he reasoned out, when the
warriors, crammed with food, sauntered from the
wigwam, and several came leisurely to squat in
the shade close by him.</p>

<p>Among them was Aspinet himself, Miles's whittle
thrust defiantly in his leathern girdle, and the sight
of that braced the boy's resolution in soldierly fashion;
he must not seem afraid or willing to bear an
affront from a savage, he knew. So, with a steady
face, he addressed the Chief again, seeking this time
to find the Indian words: "When your people come
to us at Patuxet we do not rob them. And you
were best not rob me, else Captain Standish will
burn your wigwams."</p>

<p>For an instant the Chief puffed slowly at his
tobacco pipe, and impassively eyed Miles's face;
then he spoke, with some broken words of English
and his native words so slowly uttered that Miles
could half comprehend the import of his speech:
"We do not fear the coat-men. Thus did we to
them. There was a ship broken by a storm. They
saved most of their goods and hid it in the ground.
We made them tell us where it was. Then we
made them our servants. They wept much when
we parted them. We gave them such meat as our
dogs eat. We took away their clothes. They lived
but a little while."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Miles's eyes were wide and his lips parted with
frank horror; only for a moment, then he recalled
the hint of such a happening that had drifted to
Plymouth, and the very reiteration of the story
made it a little less shocking. "That was a French
ship, and they are a different race from us," he said
slowly. "An Englishman would not 'a' wept for
you. And <i>I</i> shall not." He drove his hands hard
into the sand and blinked fast; the rough dirt hurt
his burnt fingers, and he did not doubt the English
folk, even the Captain, were so glad to be rid of
him that they would leave him there forever, to
the mercies of Chief Aspinet.</p>

<p>Squalid though the Indian wigwams were, he was
faintly glad when the shadows had so lengthened
on the land and so darkened the sky and sea that
it was time to go to rest, for at least the blackness
would screen his face from the peering eyes of his
captors. It was to Aspinet's wigwam they led him,
but the courage to refuse the Chief's dubious hospitality
no longer endured in Miles; he would forgive
their taking his knife, if they did not use him
as they had used the luckless French sailors.</p>

<p>Obediently he snuggled down in one corner of
the bed that ran round the wigwam, crowded and
comfortless as was his bed at Manomet, but here
neither Trug nor Dolly lay beside him. The
sound of the sea, too, was strange; out-of-doors he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
could hear it,&mdash;the slow crash of the incoming tide
that grew fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>Dolly and Trug, taken from him, he knew not
to what, and the safe little town of Plymouth
whence he had fled,&mdash;all were present to him. He
thought that he and Dolly, with the old dog beside
them, were trudging up the path from the landing,
only there were trees all along the path, like the
limes along the church lane at home in England,
and the houses were not log cabins, but English
cottages. He knocked at the door of Stephen
Hopkins's house, and at the same time it was the
English farmhouse where his father had dwelt, and,
when they opened the door to him, it was his
mother who, coming across the hall, took him in
her arms and drew him in.</p>

<p>The blackness of the wigwam and the heavy
breathing of the savages came once more to his
consciousness. He dragged himself wearily up on
one elbow. Through the opening in the side of the
wigwam he saw the sky quite dark, and he heard
the receding swash of the ebbing tide. Yonder
was the ocean, and a few miles westward lay Cape
Cod Bay, and across it snug Plymouth. If he only
walked along the shore, followed the coast line, he
would come home.</p>

<p>There was no plan, scarce any hope in him, only
he knew the English had forgotten him, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
could not endure it longer with a stolid face among
the Indians. Almost ere he thought it out, yet with
instinctive precaution, he slipped off the bed, and,
holding his breath, crouched listening on the floor.</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully, with the trodden dirt firm
beneath his hands, he writhed his way to the door-opening.
The morning air struck coldly on his
cheeks, so that for an instant he shrank back, but
there was in it something free that emboldened him
to press on.</p>

<p>Out through the door into the chilly morning,
which to his more accustomed eyes seemed so pale,
he felt detection was certain. But no cry alarmed
him, no motion betrayed him. The soft sand deadened
every sound, as he crept through it, hands and
knees. The debris of twigs, higher up at the verge
of the pine woods, pressed cruelly against his palms,
but, for all the pain, he still crawled on, till darkness
thickened about him, and above him the pine
branches stirred.</p>

<p>Springing to his feet, Miles ran forward, fast as
two frightened legs could bear him. Brambles that
plucked at his tattered sleeves made him halt, with
heart a-jump; tougher young shoots near tripped
him; but pantingly he held on his way. Through
the branches he could catch a glimpse of the dull
sky and one very bright star that he judged shone
in the west, so he headed toward it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Little by little the star faded from before his eyes,
and the sky lightened, whereat Miles ran the faster.
A swamp, thick with juniper, barred his course, and
fearfully he turned southward to pick his way about
it. When once more he turned westward, the sky
was pale as lead, and the birds were beginning to sing.
But though the coming of dawn might well alarm
him, he did not heed it now, as, through the trees
before him, he caught the pounding note of waves,
and, a little later, broke forth upon a broad expanse
of meadow, beyond which rumbled the great sea.</p>

<p>Yonder, very far to west, lay Plymouth, Miles
told himself, and, with a foolish happiness springing
in his heart, he stumbled briskly along through
the sparse growth at the edge of the wood. The
morning light now was sprinkling the sea on his
right hand, and the sky was changing from lead-color
to clear blue. Out from the forest a brook,
all awake with the dawning, came gurgling, so Miles
stopped to drink, and tarried to empty the sand
from his shoes; he guessed he must have run
leagues, for he was very tired.</p>

<p>But up he got and tramped on pluckily at his
stoutest pace, through the coarse grass of a great
salt marsh, where the new-risen sun struck hot
upon him. At the verge of the marsh an arm of
the sea reached into the land, so Miles had no
course but to wade in, shoes and all. The water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
was cold as the sun before had been hot. He
clambered forth on the far side all a-shiver and, with
his head bent, began to run for warmth's sake, across
another bit of marsh and up a little wooded slope of
sand. Headlong he plunged down the opposite slope,
and there, in the hollow, by a brookside, unmoved
as the pine trees themselves, stood two of the Nauset
Indians.</p>

<p>He trudged back to the camp with them,&mdash;there
was no other way. One of them, when they came
up to him, as he stood numb with the surprise, uncertain
whether to run or front them boldly, struck
him a buffet in the face, but the other, catching his
arm, muttered something that made him desist. So
Miles stole round and walked beside the second Indian
on the trip back. They did not offer to carry
him nor to slacken their pace, and he feared to vex
them with lagging behind. His shoes, where he
had waded through the salt water, were stiffening, so
they hurt his feet sorely; by the time he came into
the camp he was fairly limping, yet that was but a
little pain beside what might be before him.</p>

<p>Yet no one did him hurt. A throng of people
gathered scowlingly about him and talked among
themselves, while he waited, with his flesh a-quiver,
but his chin thrust bravely upward. But, in the
end, they only hustled him into a wigwam, where
they left him with two squaws who were pounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
corn. Miles flung himself upon the couch, in the
farthest corner, and hid his face in his arms, but
rigidly he held himself from crying. The stone
pestles that ground the corn went thud, thud, till
his head so ached it seemed as if they beat upon
his very temples.</p>

<p>He had come to count the rhythmic strokes in
a sort of stupor, wherein he knew only that the
pestles beat, when suddenly they ceased. Out-of-doors
he heard a whooping and a scuffling of
many naked feet in the sand. He pressed himself
closer against the wall of the wigwam; they were
coming to deal with him now. He shut his eyes
tightly and buried his head deeper between his
arms.</p>

<p>They had come into the wigwam. He ought
to stand up and show them he was not afraid, but
he could not, and, when some one grasped him by
the arm, spite of himself, he cried out in nervous
terror.</p>

<p>"Me friend. You not know Squanto?" grumbled
a voice he remembered.</p>

<p>Miles sprang to his feet. The lodge was full
of savages, Aspinet and a score of other hostile
faces, but he gave them no heed, for over him
stood his old Plymouth acquaintance, the interpreter
Squanto. With a great cry of relief, Miles
flung his arms about him. "Oh, Squanto, take me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
home, quick, quick!" he begged; and in the next
breath, "Where's Dolly? You must find Dolly."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/i_275.jpg" width="320" height="500" alt="men standing in watter next to small boatload of soldiers" />
<div class="caption">"Miles made out the figures of the men in the shallop."</div>
</div>

<p>The little squaw and the puppy dog were safe,
Squanto explained leisurely; the Captain and his
warriors had come in the big canoe and taken them,
and now they waited yonder for Miles himself.
"I'll go to him straightway," cried Miles, with a
laugh that caught in his throat.</p>

<p>But, like it or no, he must wait yet a time, for
Chief Aspinet and his warriors would feast Squanto
and the Indians who came with him, and the savages
ate long and deliberately. Miles, unable to
swallow a morsel, sat between his friend Squanto
and one who came with him called Iyanough, the
Sachem of Cummaquid, a young Indian with so
gentle a bearing that the boy felt near as safe with
him as with an Englishman.</p>

<p>He could not help a little movement of repulsion,
though, as they rose from the feast at last,
when Aspinet came up to him, but the Chief was
in a humble mood now and merely handed back
the whittle, which Miles clapped promptly into
his pocket. Aspinet would have put round his
neck a chain of white beads too, but Miles shook
his head disapprovingly; he wanted no presents of
the uncivil Chief. Yet when Squanto said, "Take
um," he thought well to obey the interpreter.</p>

<p>They came forth at length from the wigwam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
under a twilight sky, and, in some semblance of
order, the whole throng of Aspinet's warriors took
up their march across the Cape. One of them
lifted Miles in his arms, and, though the boy would
have preferred some other bearer than a Nauset
man, he contented himself, since Squanto and Iyanough
walked close by.</p>

<p>At a good pace they passed up into the scrub
pines of the sand hills, and turned westward, where,
in the dull sky, the restful stars were beginning to
show, just as Miles had seen them come out above
the piny hills of Plymouth. The branches bent
noiselessly apart, as the swift train pressed forward
through the woods. The moon was up now;
Miles, glancing back, saw it gleam amid the
boughs, and at first its staring light startled him.
Then they came through the trees out on broad
sand again; the tide was far down, and out yonder,
where the line of moonlit water began, lay the English
shallop, with its sails all white.</p>

<p>Down the beach the naked feet of the Indians
pattered; now the water splashed noisily beneath
their tread, knee high, waist high. Clearly and
more clearly Miles made out the figures of the men
in the shallop, erect and musket in hand, the gleam
of the corselets and helmets, their faces almost.</p>

<p>It was Captain Standish himself, who, slipping
his ready musket to one hand, reached over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
gunwale and, grasping Miles by the waistband,
dropped him down into the bottom of the shallop.
As he did so he uttered something that sounded like
a fervent "Thank God!"</p>

<p>Miles neither heard nor heeded that, but he did
remember of a sudden that he was a wretched, little
fugitive criminal, now delivered into the hands of
English justice, and even his hero, who had been
his friend, had thought fit to take him up roughly
and drop him down against his boots. He rolled
a little out of the way, and, crouching against the
side of the boat, buried his face in his arms.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>FALLEN AMONG FRIENDS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AT last the shallop had put off from the
Nauset shore. The babel of clamorous
Indians sank down, and, in its stead,
sounded the thud of muskets laid by and the clatter
of sweeps fitting to the rowlocks. Sharp English
commands Miles heard too, but still he did not
raise his head, till some one lifted him to his
feet.</div>

<p>All about him gleamed the hard whiteness of
moonlight, under which the idle sail looked vast and
ghostly and the faces of the men around him seemed
unfamiliar. But he heard Captain Standish's voice:
"Come, Miles, clamber forward with you. Your
sister is fair sick for the sight of you."</p>

<p>He saw it was the Captain who had lifted him
up, and he caught the arm that held him. "I'm
sorry, sir, oh, I'm mighty sorry; I won't fight
another duel nor run away," he whispered huskily.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, my man," the Captain spoke hurriedly.
"It's well over and you're safe with us now.
Here, Gilbert Winslow, help him forward; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Stephen Hopkins, draw you nearer; I've a word
to say."</p>

<p>Dumbly obedient, Miles clambered forward over
the thwarts. Young Gilbert Winslow, one of the
rowers, put out a hand to steady him, and, to the
boy's thinking, grasped his arm roughly. They
need not begin punishing him at once, he reflected
miserably; he was sorry for all he had done, but
when he tried to tell them so, even the Captain
had thought him whimpering because he had been
afraid.</p>

<p>Then for a moment he forgot his wretchedness,
as he reached the forward thwart where Alden sat,
and from beside him heard Dolly's voice pipe up.
Miles slipped upon the reeling bottom of the shallop,
and, stumbling closer to his sister, put his arms
about her. "You're here, Dolly?" he asked, in
a whisper, half afraid to let his voice sound out.
"You're safe, you and Trug?"</p>

<p>Such a ragged, tousled Dolly as she was, half
hidden in the folds of Alden's cloak, and almost too
weary even to talk. She was quite safe, though, she
found energy to tell him, and Trug was there behind
her, tied in the peak of the bow. He was sore with
his bruises, but Goodman Cooke said he would live,
for all that. The Indians of Manomet had done
neither of them further hurt, but had sent them to
the Sachem Iyanough, who was a good man and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
delivered them to the English that very morning.
So it was all well, but for the poppet.</p>

<p>"Did they take it from you?" questioned Miles,
mindful of his own experience with the whittle.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no," answered Dolly, beginning to sniffle.
"I&mdash;I did give her to a little maid at Manomet.
Because she ground the corn and fetched wood all
day, and she had no poppet. I gave it to her, and&mdash;and
the bad old Chief, he took her away from
the little maid&mdash;he did tear her up and make red
cloth of her&mdash;and he tied her in his hair, my poppet
Priscilla." Dolly curled herself up against
Alden's arm and wept wearily.</p>

<p>"Very like Priscilla Mullins can make you
another," the young man suggested kindly, though
his face, in the moonlight, looked amused.</p>

<p>"'Twould not be she," wailed Dolly, provoked
at such stupidity, and went on to cry as only a very
tired little girl can cry.</p>

<p>But Miles, quite tearless, leaned back against
Alden's knees, and, without daring to look at the
men about him, gazed up into the shimmery sky.
All the time, though, he was conscious that yonder
in the stern sat Master Stephen Hopkins, and he
thought of him and tormented himself with wondering
what punishment he would inflict till he felt it
almost a relief, when at last his guardian came striding
across the rowers' seats toward him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>He came, indeed, but to help Alden unfurl the
sail, for they were now well out from shore, and the
breeze, though of the faintest, was worth calling to
their aid. But when that task was done, Master
Hopkins set himself down on the thwart by Alden,
and presently spoke to Miles, who started guiltily,
for all nothing worse was said than, "Take my
cloak here, Miles Rigdale, and wrap it about you."</p>

<p>It was chilly, now they were out on the open bay,
as Miles, in his torn shirt, knew, but, without looking
at the speaker, he shrank away, muttering:
"I wish it not. I am not cold, sir."</p>

<p>"Take the cloak as I bid you," Master Hopkins
repeated, in as stern a voice as if it were a dose of
poison he were pressing upon Miles. "Let me
have no more of this sullenness."</p>

<p>He spoke so sharply and loudly that every one
must hear; Miles thought to feel the indignant eyes
of the company turn toward him. "I&mdash;I want to
go up in the bow beside Trug," he whispered Alden,
and, eager to put as much space as possible between
himself and Master Hopkins, clambered over the
thwart into the peak. There he crouched close to
the battered old dog, who licked his hands, and lay
so covered by the cloak that he could see only the
blank moon rolling through the blue-black sky.</p>

<p>But, though he did not look on his companions,
he could hear their voices distinctly. Alden it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
who spoke first: "We are not heading for home the
quickest way, are we, sir? We follow the shore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis that the Captain holds it best that we stand
in to land and get fresh water," Hopkins made answer.
"After that we are to hasten our shortest way
unto Plymouth. For there's ill news astir at Nauset."</p>

<p>"What might that be?"</p>

<p>"They tell us the Narragansetts, that fierce tribe
to southward, have risen and spoiled some of Massasoit's
men and taken the King himself prisoner."</p>

<p>There was an instant's silence, during which Miles
listened strainingly, then Alden spoke in a different,
slow tone: "And after they have dealt with Massasoit,
should they attack Plymouth because it is allied
to him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The pick of our fighting men are here in the
shallop," Hopkins answered deliberately.</p>

<p>Miles felt something press against his legs as he
lay, heard a sleepy whimper from Dolly. "Let
your sister rest by you, Miles," spoke Alden, bending
over him. "I'm going to aid at the sweeps."</p>

<p>"And you, Miles," added Master Hopkins, "were
best give your thought to praying unto God that
your mad prank may not prove the means of drawing
the men from Plymouth at her greatest need."</p>

<p>Once more there was silence, save for the steady
creak, creak of the oars against the thole-pins, and
now and again the flap of the listless sail. Miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
lay quite still and stared at the round moon, yet did
not see it, for before his eyes loomed only the unguarded
cottages of Plymouth, white under the
moonbeams, and, crawling toward them from the
black pine hills, the slinking forms of the Narragansett
warriors. Even when he shut his eyes and,
at last, for sheer exhaustion, slumbered, he saw in
his dreams the sleepy little settlement, all unconscious
of the danger crowding close upon it, and the
horror of this that his own folly had made possible
startled him into wakefulness again.</p>

<p>He saw the mast sway blackly against the dull
heavens, whence the moon had dropped, and, with
something of comfort in their mere presence, heard
the men grumbling inaudibly, as they tugged at the
sweeps. A dead chill was in the morning wind, so
gladly he huddled the cloak more closely about him
and drowsed once more. But the same vision of
leaping savages and blazing cottages burned before
his eyes, till, with a half stifled cry, he started up, as
through his dreams rang an Indian whoop.</p>

<p>All about him yellow sunshine rippled on the
water; English voices sounded cheerily, and with
them mingled the clatter of Indian tongues. So
much of his dream was true, yet it could be no
attack upon the shallop, for Dolly, quite unconcerned,
sat gazing down at him from the nearest
thwart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are to get up," she greeted him gayly.
"We are at Cummaquid to eat breakfast with
Sachem Iyanough; the Captain and some of the
men have gone ashore unto him, and they have sent
us roast fish hither, and there is clean bread from
home. And you are to rise and eat with us, Master
Hopkins says."</p>

<p>At that name Miles, still half dazed with sleepiness,
sprang to his feet. Near at hand, across the
noisy blue water, gleamed the green shores of
Cummaquid, where he could see a swarm of dusky
figures, and in their midst the glitter of the armored
Englishmen. But nothing of the shore or even of
the folk about him was quite real, save the voice of
Master Hopkins; Miles did not look at his face.</p>

<p>Creeping into the stern sheets, as he was bidden,
he choked down the food that was given him, good
bread and fish, that seemed to him gall and ashes.
For the men about him spoke anxiously of the need
of getting speedily to Plymouth, till Miles, heavy
with the sense of guilt, scarcely dared stir or breathe,
or even think. Only when Master Hopkins rose
from beside him did he venture so much as to shift
his position; then he swung about stealthily and
leaned his head upon one arm that rested on the
gunwale. He let one hand droop into the water,
and, watching the ripples slip between his fingers,
thought only of their flow and fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>So he was still sitting, in what looked a sullen fit,
when a good capful of wind came ruffling it along
the water, and the Captain and his squad splashed
noisily from the shore. Miles heard about him the
clatter of their embarkation, the creak of the hoisted
sail, the brisk voices of the men, and he longed to
slip back to his old place in the bow, away from
them, but he durst not venture it. He stared down
into the blue water, that now began to press more
swiftly through his hand, and, when he lifted his
eyes, the green shore was fading in the distance.</p>

<p>With a creak of the cordage, the shallop came
about on a fresh tack, so only dazzling water that
made his eyes ache now lay before Miles. Through
the rents in his shirt he felt the sun hot on his bare
shoulders, and involuntarily he made a restless
movement. "What's amiss, Miles?" spoke the
Captain's quick voice. Miles did not answer, but,
feeling rebuked, sat silent, and studied the grain of
the wood in the seat on which he perched.</p>

<p>But the Captain, sitting next him, began to ask him
questions in a curt, matter-of-fact tone, as to what
Indian villages he had entered, and whether he had
noted signs of warlike preparation, to all of which
Miles answered hesitatingly, a little frightened, because
the men about him silenced their talk to hark
to him.</p>

<p>Once he glanced sidewise at Standish, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
latter's brows were puckered and his eyes preoccupied,
so Miles, not knowing whether he was worried
about the savages or angry with him, looked again
at his shoes. But when the Captain relapsed into
grave silence, his fear grew greater than his shame
before rebuke; so at last he plucked the Captain's
sleeve and whispered him: "Is there any chance,
sir,&mdash;maybe shall we come to Plymouth ere the
Indians kill all the people?"</p>

<p>"What set such a mad fancy in your head?"
Standish asked, almost sharply. "There's not an
Indian within six league of Plymouth. Don't worry
yourself for that, lad; you'll find the village as you
left it, and all the women ready to weep over you."</p>

<p>At these first comforting words he had received
since he boarded the shallop, Miles plucked up heart
and drew closer to Captain Standish. But speedily he
took note of the anxiety that made the Captain
forgetful of him, and, with a new sorrow, he told
himself that to his hero he was no longer "Miles,
my soldier," but a foolish boy, who, because he was
little, must be spoken to gently, and not even let
know the full extent of the evil he had brought
about. For, spite of Standish's cheerful speech, he
could see clearly enough that every man in the craft
was troubled and longing to reach the endangered
settlement.</p>

<p>But the wind blew lightly, in veering flaws, so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
shallop must make tedious long tacks, while the
hours rolled out. The heat began to go from the
air, so Miles was glad to wrap himself in a spare
cloak, as the Captain ordered; and the sun, in the
west, slipped behind gray clouds. The water darkened,
and the twilight had fallen in earnest, when at
last the shallop tacked in at the outer entrance of
Plymouth Harbor.</p>

<p>At first the thickly wooded beach point screened
the shore, but, as the little craft rounded it, the dim
hills across the harbor were visible, and there, on the
greatest hill, too low for stars, Miles saw sparks of
light twinkle.</p>

<p>It was as if the men in the shallop all drew breath
again, and Miles himself, forgetting his guilt and
the punishment in store for him, cried joyfully:
"They're safe!"</p>

<p>But in a moment half the joy went from him, for,
when Alden, in the bow, fired his musket thrice,
with startling re毛choes, Master Hopkins told him
grimly that the signal was to let the people yonder
know he had destroyed neither himself nor his sister
by his sinful foolhardiness. Miles hung his head
sorrily, and, for all Captain Standish presently
clapped him on the shoulder and bade him look
how the people flocked to the landing, did not
glance up till, with a splash of oars in the quiet
water, the shallop lay to, by the dark rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>In the thick twilight the faces of the people
gathered thither could not be made out, but all the
colony was there, Miles guessed by the babel of
voices, and, after they had lifted him ashore, he
knew it was Priscilla Mullins who hugged him undignifiedly,
and he thought it was Mistress Brewster
who cried when she spoke to him. But he had no
time to make certain, for just then Master Hopkins
grasped him by the arm and led him away up the
hill to his house.</p>

<p>Within the familiar living room a candle was
alight, that set Miles blinking as he was brought in
from the darkness, but he made out Mistress Hopkins,
with an anxious scowl on her brows, though,
for all Miles's torn shirt, she did not scold one
word, and he saw Constance, with her eyes red,
and Giles, who had tramped in after him, and
Dotey and Lister. "Then they didn't hang you?"
Miles cried to the latter, too weary to be civil.</p>

<p>"Hang who?" asked Ned, pretty sheepishly, as
his master's eyes were upon him.</p>

<p>"You said they were going to hang you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not I, never," vowed Ned, with his face flushing,
and, slouching off into the bedroom, rattled the
door to behind him.</p>

<p>Miles followed him thither speedily,&mdash;he was
not to be coddled by two soft-hearted women,
Master Hopkins said,&mdash;and Giles and Dotey came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
too. They questioned him eagerly of his adventures,
but Miles, unflattered even by such attention,
would not speak of Indians or of birch
canoes, just poured forth his woes in a weary voice
upon the verge of tears: he would surely be
soundly whipped, and Ned had said they would
be hanged and they hadn't been, and if Ned hadn't
said it, he wouldn't 'a' run away.</p>

<p>"I am right sorry, for your sake, I was not dealt
with less mercifully," Lister said bitterly, and Miles,
glancing up at him, was checked in his lamentation;
truly, Ned looked miserable, with his face white and
a noticeable limp in his gait, and Dotey, too, had
one hand bandaged, but, most awe-inspiring of all,
Miles noted, as Ned unfastened his shirt, a vivid
red mark about the base of his neck. "What was
it they did to you, then?" he asked, but neither
of the Edwards seemed eager to explain.</p>

<p>"They just tied 'em neck and heels," Giles volunteered
presently, as he began undressing. "And
before they'd kept them so an hour, they promised
amendment and&mdash;Hey, Ed Dotey, make Ned cease
throwing shoes at me."</p>

<p>With a wrangling word or two peace was restored,
and the young men took themselves to rest; Miles
noted that the ex-duellists drew the line at sharing
one bed, for Ned Lister lay down beside him, while
Giles and Dotey slept together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>How quiet and clean it seemed in the little chamber,
Miles thought; and how blessed it was that the
Indians had not fallen on Plymouth! Involuntarily
he sighed for very peace and happiness, then lost all
sense of comfort at the recollection of the morrow
and the punishment deferred that yet would surely
come. "Ned, O Ned," he began, and shook Lister,
who was lying with his head between his arms.
"Tell me, Ned, how greatly does it hurt to be tied
neck and heels?"</p>

<p>"Um-m-m!" groaned the exasperated Lister.
"Miley, if you say 'neck and heels' to me again,
I'll wake up and thrash you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>A SON OF PERDITION</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>MILES was not fated, however, to learn by
experience how it felt to be tied neck and
heels; for all his double sin of abetting a
duel and running away from the settlement, he suffered
no unusual punishment. Instead, next day at
noon, when Master Hopkins returned from the
fields, he ordered him into the closet, and there gave
him as thorough a flogging as even the boy's tormented
fancy had conjured up.</div>

<p>Miles came out, with his shoulders quivering,
and, not staying for dinner, slouched away through
the fields to the shore, where he stood a time blinking
out to sea. He had been bidden go present
himself to the Elder and be admonished for his
sins, but he did not hold it necessary to go just yet.</p>

<p>At last he had himself tolerably in hand, and,
with no great heart for what was before him, was
loitering along the shingle to the village, when a
shrill voice hailed him, and, looking up, he saw
Jack and Joe and Francis running toward him. So
Miles put on an unconcerned bearing, and, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the pebbles clatter beneath his tread, swaggered to
meet them.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, he could tell them brave tales of how
he had lived with the Indians, he bragged, but not
now; he had to go now and be admonished by the
Elder, he explained, as if he took pride in such
awful depths of iniquity.</p>

<p>"And Stephen Hopkins has admonished you ere
this, I'll warrant," chuckled Francis. "How heavily
did he lam you?"</p>

<p>With melancholy satisfaction, Miles pulled off
his shirt and exhibited his stripes to his admiring
companions.</p>

<p>"Big red weals," quoth Jack. "I'm glad 'twas
not I must bear such a banging. Here's more
than one stroke has broken the skin."</p>

<p>Miles twisted his neck, in a vain effort to study
his smarting shoulders, while his estimate of himself
rose surprisingly.</p>

<p>"And for each whang Miles cried out, I'll be
bound," added Francis.</p>

<p>"I did not open my lips," boasted Miles. "A'
could not make me. You can talk, if you will,
Francie. We know if you'd borne the half of this,
we'd 'a' heard you roaring from the Fort Hill clear
to the Rock. But I mind not a beating, nor aught
they can do to me or say. 'Twas so brave a life I
led among the Indians&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>There something in Francis's face made Miles
glance over his shoulder, and right behind him, his
step deadened by the sand, stood the Captain, who
was gazing down at him with a look between contemptuous
and amused, that made the other lads
slip away, and set Miles scuttling into his shirt.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you show a deep and edifying sense
of the mischief you have done," Standish said
quietly, but the very absence of anger from his tone
made Miles's face burn the hotter.</p>

<p>He was glad that his shirt was over his head at
that moment, so he could not see the speaker's
look, and he dreaded to meet it. But when he had
drawn on the garment and could glance round him,
he saw, with an added pang of humiliation, that
Captain Standish, not holding him worthy of further
notice, had trudged on to the landing.</p>

<p>For a moment Miles stood gazing blankly after
him; then he turned and, kicking up the sand in
half-hearted little spurts, plodded on up the hill
to Master Brewster's gate. Beneath the bluff, on
the shore of the brook, he came upon the Elder,
laboring diligently among his green things, and told
him in a listless tone why he had come thither.
Master Brewster talked to him a long time and
wisely, Miles had no doubt, but he only heard the
words vaguely, for he was feeling the piteous smart
of his irritated shoulders, and watching the flecks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of light through the green bushes that shifted across
the Elder's doublet, and harking to the loud purr
of the fat cat Solomon, who was rubbing himself
against the Elder's knees.</p>

<p>Yet he was dully sorry when the Elder dismissed
him, for that left him free for some heavy thoughts.
It would be a little comfort to speak with Dolly;
so, rather uncertain what welcome such a rapscallion
as he might hope for, he toiled up the bluff and
faltered into the Brewsters' living room.</p>

<p>The wind from the sea stirred the curtain at the
window, and in the full blast, industriously sewing
at a small gown, Mistress Mullins sat alone. "So
you've come to visit me, little Indian?" she greeted
Miles, and put her hands to her brown hair that
had ruffled in the draught. "My scalp is quite
safe? You are well assured you have no tomahawk
about you?"</p>

<p>Miles shook his head in crestfallen fashion; he
only wanted to see Dolly, he murmured.</p>

<p>"She is in bed, poor little one! till I make her
some tidy clothes to put on," Priscilla answered.
"Stay and talk with me, Miles, like a gallant lad.
Come, if you'll look merry again, I'll show you
something rare. 'Tis a humbird."</p>

<p>She led him to the western casement, where on
the window-sill rested a little cage of paper, in which
fluttered a shimmery atom no bigger than a bee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
For a moment, because Priscilla expected it of him,
Miles gazed at the tiny whirring wings, and touched
the cage gently, but in so listless a fashion that the
young girl asked abruptly: "What has gone wrong
with you, Miles?"</p>

<p>"Naught."</p>

<p>"Then you are an uncivil youth to wear such a
glum face. Come, tell me it all. Is it that Stephen
Hopkins hath flogged you?"</p>

<p>"No!" Miles answered, with an angry sniff.
"A beating more or less, 'tis nothing to a man."</p>

<p>Priscilla suddenly put an arm about his neck.
"My poor little&mdash;man!" she said, and, for all she
laughed, her voice was tender. "I know I am but
a silly woman, yet mayhap I can help you,&mdash;an
you let me. Is it that the Elder rated you grievously?"</p>

<p>Miles shook his head, then, spite of himself,
blurted out: "'Tis&mdash;Captain Standish is angry and
scarce will look at me. And he has ever been kind
to me. But now he will have none of me. I had
no mind to be so wicked; I did not mean what I
said; I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Why, you need not lay it to heart if the Captain
has been round with you," the girl coaxed. "He
must be so troubled now with all this ill news of
the savages."</p>

<p>"But he&mdash;he thinks I'm not sorry," Miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
faltered, twisting the ends of the window curtain
relentlessly between his hands. "And I am, but I
can't go to him and say it, when he is angered."</p>

<p>"But I can go to him and tell him you are sorry,
if 'twill comfort you," Priscilla answered coolly.
"I have no fear of your Captain."</p>

<p>"Will you so?" Miles cried gratefully. "Sure,
you're uncommon good. When I'm older I'll
marry you,&mdash;unless Jack Alden does it ere then."</p>

<p>Whereat Mistress Mullins's face flushed pink,
and she pulled Miles's ears, and, calling him a
scamp, packed him into the bedroom to speak with
Dolly.</p>

<p>So, when Miles ran home to supper, he was in
an almost cheerful mood, which speedily ended, for
Master Hopkins made him read a sorrowful chapter
on the wrath of God against transgressors, and
cuffed him because he could not pronounce the
word "Zarhites." Mistress Hopkins scolded too,
because she had labored all the afternoon to mend
the shirt which Miles had worn upon his wanderings;
moreover, she would have to make the troublesome
boy a new doublet, to replace the one he had
lost, and new breeches, for those he now wore were
disgracefully ragged, so perhaps she had reason to
be vexed on his account.</p>

<p>"But I did not tear them wantonly," Miles
lamented to Ned Lister next morning. "Yet she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
says she is so busied she cannot make me new
clothes for days, and I must wear my breeches all
ragged for punishment."</p>

<p>"Hm!" answered Ned. "Half Plymouth seems
to take its diversion in punishing the other half."
He was on his knees between two rows of the
rustling green cornstalks, where he was grubbing
up those weeds that were so tough as to resist his
hoe; his doublet was off, but he had so scrupulously
turned up the collar of his shirt that no trace of the
red mark about his neck could be seen.</p>

<p>It was so unusual for Ned to work that Miles
was lingering to watch him, when suddenly the
young man broke out: "Look you here, Miley,
you were with me that day I made Dotey to fight
me, and you heard all I said unto him, so I ought
to tell you&mdash;'twas not he bore tales of me unto
Hopkins; 'twas the mistress herself."</p>

<p>Miles nodded his head. "I never had any
liking for her," he said softly.</p>

<p>Ned weeded scowlingly. "Well, she made Hopkins
go unto the Governor and beg that Ed Dotey
and I be released after we'd been tied an hour," he
admitted, in a grudging tone. "She might be
worse, and so might Ed Dotey; he's no talebearer,
though he is a self-sufficient coxcomb."</p>

<p>For several days this was the only bit of private
talk which Miles had with Ned, for Master Hopkins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
who said that Lister had already corrupted
the boy sufficiently, took now a new course of keeping
the two rigorously apart. While Ned was sent
to work in the fields, Miles was bidden weed in
the house-garden, or fetch and carry for Mistress
Hopkins.</p>

<p>Master Hopkins believed, too, that Satan found
mischief for idle hands, so he saw to it that one
task followed another, till Miles, honestly wearied,
looked back with fondness to his life among the
Indians as a time of perpetual holiday. One morning,
indeed, about a week after his return to Plymouth,
when he was forbidden to help Ned dig
clams, and ordered, instead, to fetch water and then
weed in the garden, he voiced his rebellious wish:
"I would I were back with those good, friendly
Indians at Manomet."</p>

<p>Master Hopkins, who was busy at the delicate
task of repairing the lock of his musket, looked up
at the muttered words. "You wish to dwell among
those shameless idolaters?" he questioned grimly.
"Verily, Miles Rigdale, you are a son of perdition."</p>

<p>A very terrible name that was, Miles thought,
but it was worse than the hard name, that Master
Hopkins cuffed him till his ears tingled and his
eyes watered.</p>

<p>Frightened at his own wickedness, and smarting
with the blows, he hurried off to the spring, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
halfway thither, met with Francis Billington. Even
Francis's sympathy would have been welcome just
then, and, after all he had undergone because of his
confession to save the boy, Miles thought he had
some claim to it. But Francis stiffened up at his
greeting and put on a surprising new air of virtue.
"I'm forbid to have to do with you, Miles," he
announced, with open delight. "Sure, I see not
why your father ever need keep you so tenderly
from my conversation. Why, you are yourself the
worst lad in all the colony; 'twas Captain Standish
himself said so to my father."</p>

<p>"I think you are not speaking the truth," Miles
answered doggedly; he had a mind to fight Francis
for such a story, but very likely if he fought, Master
Hopkins would whip him. So he drooped his
head under the other's taunt and plodded on to the
spring. He didn't believe Francis, he repeated to
himself, while he swallowed and swallowed in his
throat. But there came the remembrance of the
look the Captain had given him, there on the shore,
and his contemptuous words, and, with a sickening
fear that, for once, Francis had spoken the truth,
he felt the lump in his throat swell bigger.</p>

<p>He did not care, though the water, as he scooped
up his pailful at the spring, slopped over his shoes,
but he did care when he heard on the pathway from
the bluff the scatter of pebbles under a quick footstep;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
he could not let any one see him in so sorry
a mood. Catching up his pail, he pressed into the
crackling green alders at the farther side of the
spring, and, as he did so, heard some one call
sharply, "Miles."</p>

<p>It was Captain Standish's voice, Captain Standish
who would want to rate him as the worst lad in the
colony, who would never believe he was penitent.
Miles put his head down and, crashing through the
alders, never paused till the whole dense thicket lay
between him and his pursuer. He could hear on
the lifeless, hot air no sound save that of his own
fluttering breath; no one had offered to follow him,
and he felt suddenly sorry that he had escaped.</p>

<p>But, without courage to go back to the spring
and face the Captain, he crouched down beneath
the bushes and sat a long time staring through the
leaves at the bright water of the brook. Up in the
street he heard eager voices once, but the dread of
encountering Captain Standish made him stay quiet
in his hiding place, till the street was still again.
Then he clambered painfully up the steeper part
of the bluff below Cooke's house, and, with a new
terror growing on him of the mighty scolding he
could expect for his delay, scudded home.</p>

<p>But no one had space to scold him. When he
came to the house he found Mistress Hopkins,
quite silent, and Constance, with a scared face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
busied about dinner, and Ned and Dotey, with
Giles to help, overhauling their muskets. "What
is it has happened?" Miles questioned in amazement.</p>

<p>"War!" Ned answered cheerily, and Mistress
Hopkins, with a grewsome sort of satisfaction, added
that she always said they'd yet be slain by the
heathen savages.</p>

<p>"It happened at Namasket, five league from
here," Ned ran on. "Squanto and two other
friendly copper-skins, Hobbamock and Tokamahamon,
they went thither quietly to learn how much
truth was in this talk of rebellion against Massasoit.
And there was a certain Corbitant, an under-chief
of the King's, who is in league with the Narragansetts,
and he discovered them. Hobbamock broke
from them and came fleeing hither, not an hour
agone, but Tokamahamon they took and Squanto
they've slain. So we are furbishing up our muskets."</p>

<p>Poor Squanto, who had fetched him from Nauset,
was dead. That was Miles's first thought, and he
was honestly grieved. But ere dinner was out he
learned from his elders that there was other fearful
matter to think on, for if Massasoit's men were
rebelling and joining the Narragansetts against the
King and his allies, it meant a dreadful danger for
the settlement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Quietly, but resolutely enough, the Englishmen
made their arrangements to march against Namasket
and punish the slayers of their friends. After a night
of watching and half hidden fear, next morning, in
the midst of a beating rain, a little squad of ten,
with the Captain at their head, and Hobbamock to
guide them, went forth to the attack.</p>

<p>From the western window Miles watched them go.
He had hoped to be allowed to slip forth from the
house and see them start upon their expedition; at
least get a last glimpse of Captain Standish, who,
perhaps, in the confusion, would forget he was angry
and say, "Good-morrow, Miles," as he used. So
Miles fetched Master Hopkins's buff-coat, and
helped Constance with the breakfast kettle, and
mended the fire, and quieted Damaris, and waited
and hoped, till he saw the last man of the column
disappear over the bluff.</p>

<p>He could run out and seek a dry stick of wood
from the pile now, when going forth profited him
nothing. He slouched into the wet and the wind,
and, in the pashy dooryard, met Ned, who was in a
bad temper, because, when he asked his master to
let him go on the expedition, he had been contemptuously
bidden by Hopkins to "stay home
with the women and tend the disgraceful hurts he
had taken in his godless brawl."</p>

<p>"If I'd not been such a Jack as to get myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
slashed, I might 'a' gone," Ned grumbled now to
Miles, as he kicked his heels in the big puddle before
the doorstone. "And they'll have some good
fighting, I'll wager."</p>

<p>"Do you think surely some of our men will be
slain?" Miles questioned, terror-stricken.</p>

<p>"A buff-coat does not make a man immortal,"
Ned cast over his shoulder, as he stamped into the
house.</p>

<p>But Miles, standing in the pouring rain, gazed
up the path by which the little company had gone.
The sky was thick gray, and the rain, driven by
the wind from off the harbor, fell in long, livid
streaks. He took up a shiny wet stick from the
ground and snapped it slowly in his hands. "The
Captain may be killed," he told himself dazedly.
"And he does not know that I be sorry."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>BETWEEN MAN AND MAN</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>ALL that night the rain fell steadily; harking
to its slow patter on the roof, Miles
thought on those who were tramping the
forest, and wondered how they fared. Ned, stretched
beside him, save for his regular breathing, lay like
one dead, and yonder in the living room he could
hear Trug, admitted to shelter from the rain, grumbling
in his sleep.</div>

<p>A long, long night it was, and the day that followed,
all blurry with faint sunshine, was well nigh
as long. Little work was to do in the wet fields,
so Miles fetched pails of water and tended the fretting
babies, while, like every other soul in the colony,
he waited for news of the Captain and his men.</p>

<p>A second night, sickly with warm mist, had
closed in on Plymouth, before tidings came. Miles
and Giles had gone forth together into the moist
darkness to the spring, where they drank, before
drawing a last bucketful for the house; the alders
looked startlingly dense against the lighter black of
the sky, and Miles kept close to Giles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the elder boy was more alert than his
wont, and jumped listening to his feet, when far
up the Namasket trail sounded ordered footsteps.
"'Tis father and the men returning," he cried next
moment, and scrambled swiftly up the bluff, with
Miles, eager yet half in dread lest ill had befallen,
panting after.</p>

<p>Down through the dusk of the trail men were
coming&mdash;the heavily armed Englishmen and in
their midst some scantily clad savages. Giles, forgetful
of reserve for once, pressed forward boldly to
meet his father, but Miles, having no one to meet,
stood back in the bushes, that touched his face
clammily, and watched the little column, noisy now,
as home approached, swing past. At its head
marched a stocky figure that he knew, and, as if the
Captain could see him even in the blackness, Miles
shrank a little farther into the bushes.</p>

<p>Yet he joined himself to the very end of the column,
for he had no will to stay alone in the dark.
Goodman Cooke marched there, and, eager to have
some friend in the party, Miles fell into step beside
him. "You are all come back safe, sir?" he asked
propitiatingly.</p>

<p>"Surely, yes," the other replied. "All sound,
save three Indians we fetched hither to the Doctor.
Best of all, we've Squanto here; we found him
unhurt."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>By this they had come down into the village,
where all the people, it seemed, had hurried forth,
and, hearing the news of their interpreter's return,
showed no small joy thereover. Squanto, a figure
of varying light and shade beneath the lantern glow,
took such expressions of kind feeling stolidly, and
profited from the good wishes of his white friends
by asking for strong water. There was some merriment
thereat among the Englishmen,&mdash;all were in
good spirits, in truth, for the expedition had fared
well.</p>

<p>In broken fragments Miles caught the story as
he was hustled about among the returned soldiers
and, with the other lads, stood staring at them
under the lantern light: how the Englishmen, coming
at midnight to Namasket, had beset the house
of Corbitant, but found that valiant chief had fled
at the mere rumor of their approach; how several
of the Indians, trying to press forth in spite of their
promises that no harm was meant them, had been
hurt; how Squanto and Tokamahamon had been
found alive; and how, after leaving for Corbitant a
stern warning as to what he might expect if he
continued to stir up rebellion against Massasoit
and his allies, they had returned, successful and
unscathed.</p>

<p>But the story was quickly told by the hungry
men, and then they scattered to their houses. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
street was swiftly emptied, and even Giles, calling
to Miles to fetch home the bucket they had left
at the spring, trudged away with his father.</p>

<p>Miles turned slowly up the street; he had admitted
it to no one, even to Giles and Ned, but the
last week he had had a fear of the black woods.
Spite of his boasts to the boys of his merry life with
the savages, he shuddered every time he thought of
Nauset, and he had a foolish feeling that if he ventured
into the forest the Indians might swoop down
on him again. In the daytime he could laugh it
away, but at night, and especially after the anxiety
of the last twenty-four hours, the fear came on him
strongly, and it did not seem as if the courage was
in him to go down to the inky spring alongside the
stepping-stones that led to the woods.</p>

<p>He stood a time by Cooke's gate, in the hope that
he might see some one else bound for the spring, but
no one came. He went a few steps down the
street, but, if he returned to the house without the
bucket, he would be scolded, so, at a snail's gait,
he trudged uphill again.</p>

<p>Then it was that he noted the companionable
light that shone in the window of Standish's cottage,
high up the hillside, and, though he was afraid of
the Captain, yet there seemed a kind of encouragement
in that shiny spark that made him cross the
street and loiter nearer. "Maybe John Alden'll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
going to the spring," he told himself. "Or maybe&mdash;maybe
I'll go, presently."</p>

<p>Just at the edge of the Captain's unfenced dooryard,
he halted and stood gazing at the light. He
was not spying, to be sure; he would go in a
moment. Through the open window he could see
a corner of the living room, a table, with a rack
and three guns above it, and, as he gazed, Alden, a
big, black figure, strode into the bright corner and
set down two bowls on the table. Miles drew
a step or two nearer. "Maybe the Captain will
come into the light next," he told himself. "And
after I've seen him, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then some one took him firmly by the
shoulder, and right beside him spoke the Captain's
voice, "Well, Miles?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" the boy gasped, and then, in a panic-stricken
tone, "I'm going home; prithee, let me go
home, sir."</p>

<p>"Nay, you are coming in with me," Standish
answered, and, helplessly, Miles yielded to the
other's grasp and stumbled over the threshold.</p>

<p>Within, the living room was bare and martial, with
a rapier above the chimneypiece that caught a
gleam from the candle set below it, and the form
by the door and the rough stools standing stiffly as
on parade. On a shelf beside the fireplace there
were some pots and platters; Miles noted all very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
accurately, and wondered that he should note them
at such a time.</p>

<p>He started when Captain Standish spoke, for all
his tone was amused: "Here, Jack, set a bowl for
this gentleman I have fetched to sup with us. And
you, Miles, will you give me your parole not to
attempt an escape, if I take my hand from your
collar?"</p>

<p>Miles eyed the shaft of candlelight that lay at his
feet and ventured no answer. He knew the Captain
had loosed his grasp on him, and then he heard
him ask, in a different, serious tone: "Are you
afraid of me?"</p>

<p>At that Miles tossed back his head, stiffly as if a
bar of iron were run down his neck. "No, sir,"
he said, boldly and untruthfully.</p>

<p>He could not slip away now, whatever might be
in store for him, but stood rigid and unpretending,
while Captain Standish flung off his buff-coat, and
Alden, with a ponderous movement, lifted the soup
kettle to the table. Then he sat down on a stool,
as he was bidden, and ate. It was clam broth, and
he was aware of the good flavor of it, just as he was
aware, beneath all his alarm, of the honorable fact
that he was taking supper with Captain Standish.
He began to hazard long looks at the Captain and to
listen to the talk of the two men, with some thought
for their words, as well as for his own concerns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is none of your cooking, Jack," said
Standish, as he rose to refill his bowl.</p>

<p>"Mistress Mullins fetched us the broth," Alden
replied, with a studious lack of interest. "She
thought we'd have naught to eat in the house to-night."</p>

<p>"'Twas very wisely thought. When you have
eaten, Jack, best carry back her kettle. They'll
not yet be abed at the Elder's house."</p>

<p>Somehow, after that, Alden made short work of
his portion, and, summarily emptying the kettle
into the Captain's bowl, gave it a perfunctory scrub
and started briskly for Master Brewster's cottage.</p>

<p>The Captain, with his face sober all but his eyes,
swallowed his broth in leisurely silence for a moment
before he addressed his small companion: "I had
speech with Priscilla Mullins several days since.
What is this, Miles, that she tells me you had to
say to me?"</p>

<p>Miles crumbled the fag end of his piece of bread
with one nervous hand. "Why, 'twas&mdash;'twas&mdash;Captain
Standish, is it true you think me the worst
lad in the settlement?" He looked up into the
other's face, and something he saw there made him
blurt out, "I doubt if you do."</p>

<p>"So that's why you ran away from me day before
yesterday, is it?"</p>

<p>Miles kicked his heels softly against the legs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
his stool. "Because I want to tell you I'm sorry,"
he murmured. "I shall never run away to the
Indians again. I&mdash;I was but talking when I said
those words unto Francis and the others."</p>

<p>"A 'miles gloriosus,' eh?" said the Captain, and
smiled.</p>

<p>Miles saw nothing amusing in the words, but he
took it as a sign the Captain was his friend again,
so he smiled back. "I won't do it again, sir," he
promised vaguely, and then, as Standish rose from
the table, he slipped off his stool. "May I wash
the dishes, sir?" he volunteered for "a girl's work"
eagerly.</p>

<p>"If you wish it," the Captain answered, and then,
about the time Miles had dropped the bowls and
spoons into the nearest pail of water, broke out
irrelevantly, "In the name of goodness, Miles, are
those the only breeches you have to wear?"</p>

<p>Miles clapped his right hand over one knee, and
his left over an ostentatious rift in the side. "She
hasn't time to make me new ones; I'm wearing
these for punishment," he explained.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Standish; he took his pipe from
the chimneypiece and, filling it, kept silent so long
that Miles finished his dishes and stole over to the
hearth beside him. On the chimneypiece some
books stood up from the miscellaneous litter, and,
because they were the Captain's books, Miles raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
himself on tiptoe to read their names. A "Bariffe's
Artillery Guide" pleased him most; he was wondering
if he could learn from that how to be a soldier
like the Captain, when behind him spoke a familiar
voice: "Well, Miley, do you have it in mind to
sleep at home to-night?"</p>

<p>Miles swung round with a start; Master Hopkins
and that bucket of water and the scolding to
come,&mdash;he remembered all clearly, for there in
the doorway stood Ned Lister, with his out of
temper look. "The master sent me to find the
boy," he explained more civilly to the Captain.
"I've sought him all through the village. Come,
Miles, Master Hopkins&mdash;"</p>

<p>Involuntarily Miles pressed close to the Captain.
"Is he going to whip me, Ned?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Tell Master Hopkins I'll send the lad home
straightway," Standish dismissed Lister curtly, then
puffed a moment at his pipe till the young man's
leisurely footsteps died out in the yard. "So Master
Hopkins whips you often?" he questioned abruptly.</p>

<p>"He says I need the rod," Miles answered in a
woful voice, wondering if the Captain would take his
part. "He says I'm a son of perdition. I see not
why 'tis right. When Ned Lister called Dotey a
fool, he said he was in danger of hell fire, and, sure,
son of perdition is a worser name than fool."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hm!" muttered the Captain. "And you're
still good friends with that valiant duellist, Edward
Lister?"</p>

<p>"I like Ned mightily, yes. But Master Hopkins
does not suffer me work near him."</p>

<p>"That's for punishment, too, I take it?"</p>

<p>Miles nodded.</p>

<p>"At this rate you should prove the best lad in
the colony, not the worst," the Captain said dryly;
and then, "Say we walk down to Master Hopkins's
house now, and see how that wounded Indian is
faring."</p>

<p>A queer, vague hope that had risen in Miles vanished
and left an amazing emptiness; the blackness
of the lonely spring, and the whipping for that evening's
tarrying came to his mind before he had
crossed the room, and in the doorway he halted short.</p>

<p>"What's amiss?" asked Standish, with no great
surprise, however.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I take it, I'm afraid," gasped Miles, hot
and cold with the shame of the terror he could not
check. "I must go down to the spring, and 'tis
dark, and I think I'll be whipped, and&mdash;and&mdash;"
His lips were twitching childishly. "But I wasn't
afraid at Nauset, not a whit, and I didn't cry there,"
he added piteously.</p>

<p>"I understand," the Captain said, with amazing
kindness. "I'll go to the spring with you, Miles."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>For the second time in his life, Miles stepped out
into the night with the Captain, but there was small
elation in his heart with the knowledge of his cowardice
upon him. He felt a censure in his companion's
silence, yet he dared not speak himself, only
hurried forward as fast as possible to end the walk.
They left the last cottage behind them, passed a
menacing clump of bushes, and then, at the head of
the path, Miles spoke out, almost in spite of himself:
"Pray you, go back, sir. I'm not afraid. I
won't be afraid. I'll go alone."</p>

<p>He called back the last, halfway down the path.
The pebbles rattled with shocking loudness; there
in the thicket, across the sullen brook, something
stirred, he knew. With his eyes on the black
ground, he stumbled toward the gurgle of the spring,
groped for his bucket, fearing lest his hand touch
something else, and, seizing it, filled it sparsely at
the first dip, then, setting his teeth tight, made himself
fill it again, slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>Behind him, as he rose, the bushes all were moving
and alive, and something, he knew, pressed close
at his heels. He could not hurry with the bucket
in his hand, only clamber, step by step, with the
breath choked within him, till he came at last to the
black pathway above the bluff. Before he could
cast a frightened look up the trail, the bucket was
quietly taken from him. "You waited here for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
me?" Miles gasped, and then, "But I wasn't
afraid."</p>

<p>"You will not be next time, Soldier Rigdale,"
Standish answered him, and, putting a hand on his
shoulder, kept it there.</p>

<p>Before they were into the thick of the settlement,
he spoke again, abruptly: "So you're not happy at
Master Hopkins's?"</p>

<p>"I hate it there," Miles said under his breath,
and then the hope that the Captain's former words
had raised swept back once more, and he caught the
other's hand. "Will you take me away from him,
sir?" he asked hurriedly. "If I could live with
Jack Cooke, anywhere else, I know I could be
good."</p>

<p>"I know you could, too," Standish answered.
"And I think your father and mother would wish
it. But Master Hopkins is your guardian and your
kinsman; I can do naught, only try my hand at
coaxing, and I'm uncommon ill at that. My faith,
I know not why I speak it out to such a babe as
you, Miles, but you must say naught of this, remember.
Only&mdash;if 'twill comfort you for your
tattered breeches and the rest of your penances,&mdash;so
soon as pretext is given me, I am minded to
take you from Master Hopkins to live with me."</p>

<p>"With you?" Miles asked in the blankness of
joy, and then he must hush, for the candlelight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
from Master Hopkins's window struck across his
face, and an instant later they came into the living
room.</p>

<p>Master Hopkins looked angry, of course, but his
face relaxed at sight of the Captain, and he only
bade Miles pack off to bed. "But he'll surely
thrash you in the morning, Miles," Giles said, with
a sober pucker of the brows. "What made you
stay so long?"</p>

<p>"I was with the Captain," Miles replied light-heartedly,
and to himself he added, "And by and
by 'twill be like this evening every day, for I'll live
with him all the time."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE BEARER OF TIDINGS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>CAPTAIN STANDISH must have spoken
to Master Hopkins of other matter than
wounded Indians, for, to his surprise, Miles
got no whipping next morning. "Since the Captain
needed you, I cannot punish you for your
delay," Master Hopkins said curtly, a remission
which would have overwhelmed Miles, if it had not
been surpassed by the joyous fact of Mistress Hopkins's
bringing out an old suit of his father's that
afternoon and starting to make him new clothes.</div>

<p>In duty bound Miles went forth, and, seeking
Priscilla, thanked her awkwardly that she had spoken
for him to the Captain. He wasn't seeking Francis
Billington, he would have declared, but somehow
he sauntered to the shore, where Francis was likely
to be, and, true enough, there he was, paddling in
the water by the landing rock.</p>

<p>Miles halted on the beach and resumed the talk
where it had stopped at their last meeting. "Hm,"
he sniffed at his old enemy, "I take it, Captain
Standish has other things to do than gossip about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
me to your father. You lied to me, Francis Billington,
when you said he called me the worst boy in
Plymouth, and I'm going to thrash you for that
lie."</p>

<p>"I was but jesting," vowed Francis.</p>

<p>Miles, with his aggressive fists, smote the boy and
rolled him in the sand. "I'm jesting too, now," he
said grimly.</p>

<p>Francis fled howling home, and Miles, with his
shoulders well back, swung away to the corn-field.
"I <i>had</i> to beat Francis," he assured himself, "but
now I'll not fight nor run from labor any more, but
bear me well, because I am to go live with the
Captain soon."</p>

<p>But Miles's "soon" proved, after all, a long, and,
in some ways, a cheerless time. There were many
days still to spend in his guardian's house, where
Mistress Hopkins scolded at his carelessness, where
Master Hopkins bade him work when he had
thought to win an hour's playtime, and where more
than once, sorry to tell, Master Miles himself
strayed wantonly into mischief and was sternly but
justly punished therefor.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, now that he had a big, pleasant
hope to live forward to, he found it easier to bear
what was not to his liking in the present. After
all, when he tried, it was not so difficult as he had
thought to do Master Hopkins's bidding, Miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
told himself, and never realized how much easier it
was for him to perform his tasks, while Ned Lister,
still sulky and subdued from his public punishment,
was working fiercely and would not pause to idle
with him.</p>

<p>Thus in little, dull labors and the large pleasure
of looking forward, the muggy August days panted
out their course and the September twilights shortened.
A long, secure time of peace it was for the
settlement, in which there fell but one incident,&mdash;an
expedition which ten of the Plymouth men undertook
far up the coast to the Bay of the Massachusetts,
where they traded for skins and made a
league with the Indians. Ned, who was one of the
company,&mdash;because, Giles Hopkins told Miles,
laughingly, he was held too much of a firebrand to
be left behind,&mdash;came home with something of his
old braggart manner, and told big stories that set
young Rigdale wild with envy. Why could not
he be a man at once, a full-sized man with a musket,
and go with the Captain to trade or fight with the
savages?</p>

<p>But presently there was manly work in which
Miles shared, for with the rare October days came
the time of harvesting, when, as in the weeks of
planting, every man and boy in the colony must
bear a part. It was good weather to work, though,
with nothing of the sickly heat of the April days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
but a bracing air nerved every muscle, and the sky
was deep and clear.</p>

<p>Miles liked the stir and freshness of trudging to
the fields, one of the whole company, in the awakening
cool hours of the morning. His task at first
was to follow after the reapers in the barley field
and gather the heavy stalks of the bearded grain
into sheaves. Then after the barley, as the days
grew shorter, they harvested the corn, a toilsome
labor, that soon became irksome to Miles, whose
part was to sit all day under cover, amidst the stiff
stalks and rustling leaves, and husk the ears till his
arms ached and his fingers were sore. By and by,
when the corn was dried, he foresaw he should have
to help shell the kernels from all those ears, and he
sighed a little, as he watched the pile rise high.</p>

<p>Yet at heart he knew that, like all the others in
the settlement, he was glad for the great heap of
yellow ears. It had been a fruitful harvest; the
pease, to be sure, had withered in the blossom, but
the increase of corn and barley was so great that
there was no fear lest the colony go hungry that
winter. Men's faces were soberly elate, and even
Master Hopkins relaxed his customary sternness.</p>

<p>But Mistress Hopkins had a mighty grievance,
for Governor Bradford, after the harvest all was
garnered, set apart a week as a time of special rejoicing.
"That means in a community of men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
even of the most godly, a week of feasting," she
lamented. "And who is it shall prepare the food
but we ten poor women and maids of the colony?"</p>

<p>To Miles, however, a week of feasting sounded
pleasant; he only wished he were Ned Lister, for
the Governor sent him and three of the other men
fowling to get provisions for the merrymaking. In
a day the four killed near enough to last the company
a week,&mdash;a great, feathery heap of woodcocks,
pigeons, quails, and plump wild turkeys. Miles
shared in the work of plucking the birds, and, for
the rest, he fetched wood, armful by armful, for the
great fires that blazed out-of-doors, and he ran dares
with the other boys, who should go farthest in
among the blazing brands, till Goodwife Billington
bore down upon them, and, chancing to collar her
own son, cuffed him mercilessly.</p>

<p>He tugged buckets of water, too, for the endless
boilings and stewings, till his back ached, but he
minded it little, for this was holiday time. The
October air was crisp; there was plenty to eat,&mdash;meat,
and bread of the fresh corn meal; and, all the
time, the zest of strangeness was added to the jubilation
by the coming of hordes of Indians to share
the English cheer.</p>

<p>The third day Massasoit presented himself, with
ninety hungry warriors, whereat not only Mistress
Hopkins but cheerful Priscilla Mullins was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
despair. But his Majesty did his part in supplying
provisions, for next morning some of his men went
into the forest and returned with five fat deer, which
he bestowed, as seemed to Miles most fitting, on
the Captain and the Governor. They were, however,
roasted for the behoof of the whole company,
and on the last day of the feast, after the Captain
had drilled his little troop before the King to do
him honor, the Plymouth people and their guests
ate of good venison.</p>

<p>The tables were spread in the fields, and Miles
held it a notable distinction that he and Giles were
bidden by the Captain wait at the one where he sat,
with Massasoit and the Governor and others of the
chiefs of the red men and white. Miles carried the
platters of meat thither, with all the decorum of
which he was master, and hoped that Standish might
throw a word to him, so his happiness was final
when, on his last trip to the table, the Captain called
him to his side. He was sitting at the left hand of
the Governor, where the light from the afternoon
sun struck athwart his face, and over opposite him
sat King Massasoit, greasy as ever, but now monarch-like
in a great robe of skins.</p>

<p>It was to him that Standish spoke, in words of
the Indian tongue of which Miles caught only
one or two. But the Captain answered his questioning
look: "His Majesty was pleased to crave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
sight of you, Miles. Truth, you put him to stir
enough last July. It was he who, when he got
tidings from Manomet, despatched the order thither
that no hurt should be done you, and sent us word
where to seek you."</p>

<p>"Did he do so much, sir?" Miles asked, and,
gazing at the stolid Indian, made him a grateful
bow. "I should like to tell him 'thank you,'" he
added. "If Squanto would say it for me,&mdash;or
you."</p>

<p>Then he tramped back again to the fire to take
his own share of the feast, a large turkey leg which
Constance had saved for him, and, whether it were
overmuch turkey or overmuch labor, he was too
tired even to rise and witness the departure of the
Indians after the board was cleared, for all he knew
the musketeers would fire them a parting volley.
'Twas toilsome work, this merrymaking, he agreed
with Priscilla, and, going weary and cross to bed, he
was glad to awake to the Sabbath quiet of the little
village, and, on the ensuing morning, drop once
more into the ordered round of duties.</p>

<p>There was naught to do in the following days
but to make ready against the coming winter, by
mending the cottages till every crevice was secure,
and fetching good supply of firewood from the
distant hills. A hint of wintry weather now was
in the chill air and the lead-colored sky, so, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
November afternoon, Miles spent hours in hunting
for his mittens that had gone astray.</p>

<p>Together he and Constance and Giles opened, in
the search, the little chest that had been Goodman
Rigdale's; it gave Miles a dull pang to turn over
the clothes his father and mother had worn, but
somehow all that sorrow seemed to have fallen very
long ago. "Yet 'tis not a year since we sailed into
the harbor," he said softly.</p>

<p>"Just a year to-morrow since we sighted Cape
Cod," answered Giles, and Constance changed
Miles's thoughts by adding: "The other ship with
our fresh supply should come now very speedily;
in about a month I heard father say we might look
for her. I hope there'll be cattle come in her;
'tis hard for the babies to have not a drop of
milk."</p>

<p>"And no butter," sighed Miles, thinking of himself.
"And if they bring oxen, 'twill be easier
ploughing, come spring; and there'll be more men
to fight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There'll be two more next spring, in any case,"
Giles interrupted. "Captain Standish says that then
Bart Allerton and I shall have muskets of our own
and be enrolled in his company."</p>

<p>In the days since the landing at Plymouth, Giles
had grown a responsible youth, but Miles, who had
been so much with him that he held himself near as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
old, was quite jealous at his last speech and wondered
if no one would offer him a musket.</p>

<p>He took himself forth from the chamber into the
living room, where Ned Lister, who was cleaning
his fowling piece and was in a good temper, as he
usually was when he was busied over his weapons,
let him meddle in the work till his fingers were
blacked. "I'm going northward to-morrow morning,
where Squanto tells me a flock of geese are
astir," Ned spoke further. "If Master Hopkins is
willing, I'll take you with me, Miley; 'tis months
since we've gone about any labor together."</p>

<p>Disappointingly, Master Hopkins was not willing,
for, when he came to his supper, he had to
report an evil rumor, which one of Miles's old enemies,
the Nauset Indians, had just brought to the
town, that a great ship had been seen on their
coast. It might be some English trader, or it
might be a French ship of war, come to dispossess
the colonists, just as the English had driven the
French, at an earlier time, from their northern settlements.</p>

<p>Still, even if 'twere a Frenchman, Ned argued,
men must eat, and must kill their food ere they
could eat it, so, at the last, his master said he might
go fowling, and even, if he did not roam too far,
take Miles with him.</p>

<p>Early next morning the two hunters set out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
lively spirits, in spite of the fact that the woods
were sombre and the sky rough with clouds that
looked, should they thrust a hand deep into them,
as if they would strike something hard and cold.
Already there had been bitter frosts, and the thick
fallen leaves, on the northward trail, rustled crisply
beneath the tread of the fowlers. Ned wore his
red cap, which blazed out bravely under the dull
trees, and his buff-jacket, too, which gave him the
martial look he liked. Miles had no such warlike
equipments, but Ned generously suffered him to
carry the fowling piece, so he felt quite like a soldier.
"I do but wish the French would come
upon us now," he panted boastfully, as he shouldered
the gun.</p>

<p>"There's small danger you'll find a Frenchman,
unless you cross the water to seek him," Ned answered.
"I'll do it, so soon as my time's out. Go
into Bohemia and fight&mdash;" There he turned off
into discourse on the joys of a life where a man
never fetched and carried, but handled a sword
like a gentleman, which lasted them for a mile along
the bare trail.</p>

<p>By then they came from among the leafless trees
of the level land to a thick piny growth at the base
of a tall hill, that blocked off sight of the ocean.
Ned was for climbing it out of hand, for, on the
other side, by the shore, he thought to find the wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
fowl, so up he scrambled, quite nimbly, since he
had long legs and tramped unburdened, while Miles
toiled after with the fowling piece. A mighty steep
hill, where the pine needles lay slippery, so Miles
stumbled and near fell, and, when he came at last to
the little barren stretch of the summit, where the
lowering sky seemed to bend down to him, he
could only drop flat and lie panting.</p>

<p>Ned cast himself down beside him, although he
did not seem weary, and, half smiling at Miles's
breathlessness, let his eyes at last turn seaward.
Lying back, Miles, too, looked out upon the gray
water, beneath the hill, that far away to eastward
merged into the gray sky, and then a sudden exclamation
made him glance at his companion.</p>

<p>Ned was sitting erect with his hand shading his
eyes, and the lines of his face were sharpened with a
sudden tenseness. "What d'ye see?" Miles began
carelessly, but the other, springing to his feet, spoke
to him in a curt tone: "Jump you up, Miles.
Look yonder, if you see aught in the offing."</p>

<p>Ned's hands turned Miles's head eastward, but,
though the boy yielded himself obediently and
gazed whither he was told, he saw only dull water
and brooding sky. Yet he was beginning to guess
the meaning of it all, and, with the heart fluttering
into his throat, he cried, "Ned, sure, you do not
think&mdash;that French ship&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>But Lister, wheeling about, had reached in two
strides a tall pine tree that spired from the summit
of the hill, and, grasping its lower branches, swung
himself upward from bough to bough. His cap
showed very red against the green of the pine
needles, and Miles watched it go bobbing toward
the tree top, with a mind so suddenly dulled that
he could think of nothing else, till at last the young
man, holding fast by one arm, swayed at the topmost
point of the pine tree.</p>

<p>A long minute Ned clung there, staring seaward
with his face sober, then headlong slipped and
scrambled from the tree. "It's a sail, true enough,"
he cried, and, as the words left his lips, came to the
ground with a crashing fall that made the branches
sway.</p>

<p>Before Miles could reach his side, Ned sprang
to his feet, stood a moment, took a single step, and
then toppled over again across the roots of the pine,
with his face working in a manner that frightened
his companion. "Are you hurt? What is it, Ned?"
he cried.</p>

<p>"Naught but my ankle," groaned Lister, struggling
to a sitting posture. "I've wrenched the
cursed thing. Tut, tut, tut! Don't waste time
here by me. Run to Plymouth. Tell them the
ship's in sight."</p>

<p>"The Frenchman?" gasped Miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can I tell, when 'tis four league off shore?"
snapped Ned. "'Tis a ship, and that's enough.
Run along with you, briskly!" Then, spite of the
pain, there came a sort of softening to his face.
"You're not afeard to go back along the trail alone,
Miley?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/i_331.jpg" width="320" height="500" alt="boy running in woods" />
<div class="caption">"The breath came gripingly in his throat."</div>
</div>

<p>"I've been in woods before now," cried the
boy, indignantly. "But&mdash;but if I go, what will
you do?"</p>

<p>"Sit here and take tobacco," Ned answered, in
his swaggering tone, and, with his hand a little
unsteady, drew his pipe from his pocket. "Give
me the fowling piece near to me, and now run your
briskest, d'ye hear? Off with you, heavy-heels,
unless you be afraid!"</p>

<p>The taunt more than all else sent Miles plunging
headlong down the hill. The needles slipped beneath
his shoes, and his knees jarred with the steepness
of the descent. Once he tripped, and, falling,
rolled over and over, and rose up in fear lest he had
hurt himself like Ned. But he could run well
enough, he found, as he stumbled into the more
level part of the trail. His briskest, and warn the
Plymouth folk, Ned bade, and suddenly Miles's
heart gave a great leap that he was to do so soldierly
a part in the Captain's sight. He drew a big breath,
and, bending his head, dashed down the trail.</p>

<p>The dry twigs snapped beneath his feet; a frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
quail, with a startling whir, flew across his
path; the branches, as he rushed by them, wavered
and shook. Below him the ground reeled and the
sky above was shot with black; the breath came
gripingly in his throat, and a pain like that of a
piercing iron bored into his side.</p>

<p>Downhill, where the ground seemed not to be
beneath him, and in the hollow splashed a brook.
He felt the chill of the water over his ankle as he
thrust his foot into it, and, stopping a moment,
he plunged his head, that ached to bursting, into
the icy ripples, then, gasping, staggered up the
opposite slope.</p>

<p>He was running heavily now, so it scarcely could
be called running, swaying from side to side of the
trail, but more than half, than three quarters, of the
way was out. The trees dwindled about him; yonder
were cleared fields; yonder the smoke rose from
cottage chimneys. Now the stubble of corn was
stiff beneath his feet; now he crashed through a
little patch of brambles; and at last, thrusting his
hands gropingly before him, he pitched up against
the door of Captain Standish's cottage. "Open!"
he called, but his voice came in a mere whisper.</p>

<p>Within, they heard him, however. The door was
flung open; he fell against Master Winslow; and
yonder by the table he had sight of the Governor
and the Elder and Master Hopkins and the Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
himself, starting up from the conference he had
interrupted. Miles reeled forward a step or two
and caught Standish's arm. "Captain Standish,"
he gasped, "the ship&mdash;the French&mdash;we saw it
from the hill&mdash;the French are in the offing."</p>

<p>Then his knees gave way and the room whirled
round. A blackness was about him in which he
heard faintly the questions and re-questions of
the men, the clatter of the house-door, a calling
in the street. Then thunderously, subduing all
other sound, he heard the crash of the great gun
upon the Fort Hill that called home from labor the
men who should defend their settlement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>THE CAPTAIN'S SOLDIER</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>LYING upon his own bed, whither Master
Hopkins had carried him, Miles harked
to the rattle of eager drumsticks in the
street, the hurried rush of footsteps, the shrill calls
of boys. Nearer, in the living room, he could hear
Mistress Hopkins's frightened tones, and the clatter
of swords as Master Hopkins and Dotey armed
themselves.</div>

<p>Presently heavy footsteps came toward him, and
Master Hopkins, with his buff-jacket half fastened,
opened the door of the chamber to question him
further of Ned. "He's hurt, and he made me to
leave him," panted Miles. "And the Frenchmen
will find him, and can you not send some one to
help him, sir?"</p>

<p>"Unless Edward Lister's neck is broke, I'll trust
him to shift for himself till we have space to look to
him," Master Hopkins answered with a grim sort of
chuckle, and just there the house-door banged open
and upon it Miles heard Giles's eager voice, "Father,
may I not carry Ned's musket, since he is not here?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Bart Allerton has one; the Captain himself said all
who could fight should get under arms."</p>

<p>Miles struggled up, with head still dizzy. "I
can fight too," he murmured, but the older folk,
without heeding him, tramped forth with their
weapons and left him to Constance and her stepmother.
But the women had terrified thoughts to
keep them busy, so busy they took no note when
presently Miles, quite recovered from his run, slipped
off the bed and darted from the house.</p>

<p>Out-of-doors the men were rallying in haste to
the shore, among them John Alden, whom Miles
hailed shrilly from the house-yard: "John Alden,
O John! May I have your fowling piece to fight
with?"</p>

<p>"Ay, take it," Alden called, without looking
round, and Miles, forgetting he was weary, scudded
his fastest up the hill.</p>

<p>He was to have a gun and fight, even if it was
no more than a fowling piece, he told himself, and,
in a happy flutter that set at naught the Frenchmen,
he clambered on the table in the Captain's
living room and dragged down the fowling piece
from the wall. He longed to take also the rapier
from the chimneypiece, but he had no right, so,
contenting himself with the gun, he hurried forth to
do his part.</p>

<p>A gray day and a strange day; high noon, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
not dinner time, for the whole order of life was
broken, and beyond lay&mdash;no one knew what. But
Miles thought on the fighting, and, with his pulses
leaping, clambered to the gun platform, where a
squad was stationed, and, ready as the best of them,
gazed out upon the ocean. There, sure enough,
loomed larger and larger a speck of white.</p>

<p>Captain Standish had gone down to the other
men on the bluff by the landing, so presently Miles
ran after him. He carried his fowling piece over
his shoulder valiantly, and he stopped at the Elder's
cottage to call to Dolly not to be afraid, and he
wondered at Mistress Brewster's alarmed face.</p>

<p>The men on the bluff, too, looked grave and anxious,
and the Captain's voice was sharp and stern.
But the boys who were allowed muskets, albeit their
faces were decorously sober, looked very happy, and
handled their weapons with such pride that Miles
grew ashamed of his paltry fowling piece.</p>

<p>"You might let <i>me</i> have the musket a little time,
Giles," he murmured to young Hopkins, who stood
beside him on the northern slope of the bluff, where
they were watching the horizon. "Surely, I could
manage it, and 'tis Ned's, anyway, and he is my
friend."</p>

<p>Giles preserved an elderly, careworn silence, and
puckered his brows upon the ominous east, when
suddenly from behind them shrilled a whistle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Miles guessed who it was before he turned, so,
though Giles and some of the others cried out in
surprise, he thought it quite a matter of course when
he saw Ned Lister coming across the fields to the
bluff.</p>

<p>Ned walked at a leisurely limp, with his fowling
piece over his shoulder, and his cap on one side; it
was not till he came nearer that Miles saw, too, that
his clothes were muddied and stuck with briers and
leaves, and his face was white to his lips, that were
set in a hard line. "Well," he greeted his fellow-colonists
civilly, "did you think I meant to sit
there in the bushes till you chose to come seek
me?"</p>

<p>There he staggered a little, so Dotey caught hold
of him, and just then Standish, striding through the
thin ranks of his company, came up. "How did
you get hither, Lister?" he asked, with whatever
surprise may have been his well in check.</p>

<p>"I walked," Ned answered, and then, as he saw
the Captain's eyes upon his muddied jacket, he
began to laugh oddly. "That is, sir, sometimes I
rolled and otherwhiles I crawled. For I did not
wish to be gulled of the fight. And&mdash;Giles Hopkins,
you thief! give me my musket."</p>

<p>"My father said I might&mdash;" Giles began, unruly
for once, but there a sudden sound of cheering on
the hilltop cut short the dispute. A man&mdash;Gilbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Winslow, they saw&mdash;came running break-neck
down the steep street, and, so far as he could be
heard, called to them, "English, an English ship!"
and then those on the bluff, too, took up the
cheering.</p>

<p>It was the sailor Trevor, who, from the Fort Hill,
had watched the ship grow larger till he vowed that
he could make out that she was rigged in the English
fashion. Still the Captain held his force together
on the bluff till the stranger's nationality
should be assured past doubt, and, meantime, he
bade Dotey and Giles help Ned Lister to the house.
"And see that he stays there," the Captain added
dryly.</p>

<p>So Ned, turned limp and unresisting of a sudden,
staggered away between the two, and Miles, though
he would fain have watched till the ship should loom
up round the beach point, thought friendship required
that he should follow after with the musket.</p>

<p>When he returned to the landing place, many
minutes later, there was no longer a doubt or a
fear, for the flag of England fluttered from the
vessel's mast. The ship <i>Fortune</i>, with the re毛nforcements
for the colony, that was not expected for
a month more, was casting anchor in Plymouth
Harbor.</p>

<p>That afternoon seemed all a hazy dream. With
a feeling that he must be some one else, Miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
watched the men make ready the shallop, saw it go
dipping across the gray harbor, and lie to beside the
great ship. He saw the first boatload of the newcomers
pull in to the landing rock, and he gazed
shyly and yet gladly at the faces of the men and
women who were to be his townsfolk. Elder
Brewster's grown up son came with them, and there
were many other young men, and a few older, and
several women, but there were very few children
among them.</p>

<p>At last, however, Miles and Jack found among
the newcomers a boy but little older than themselves,
so at once they made up to him and found
that his name was Thomas Cushman. And because
he had looked on ships and sea till he was weary of
them, they led him away from the harbor, and showed
him the spring and the Fort Hill, and laughed at him
because he was so certain he should see an Indian at
each turning, and Miles bragged to him mightily of
his experiences among the savages of the Cape.</p>

<p>It was near dusk when they came down again
through the village, where the last boatload from
the ship had just landed. The street seemed fairly
thronged with folk, and out to sea a light sparkled
on the quarter-deck of the <i>Fortune</i>, just as it used
to shine upon the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p>Feeling secure and happy, Miles bade his new
friend Thomas good night, and walked home to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
supper. "Bring firewood; we've many people to
eat with us to-night," Constance called to him from
the doorway, so he trudged on to the woodpile,
where he picked out a good armful of the piny logs,
to make a brave blaze for the friends who had come
from England.</p>

<p>His face, as he worked, was toward the west,
where showed a smear of red, which the sun, struggling
forth just ere his setting, had left behind.
Miles gazed on the gay fleck, that yet was lonely in
the wide sky, till a step near at hand startled him,
and, turning, he faced Master Hopkins.</p>

<p>"Lay aside that wood, Miles; I have to speak
with you," his guardian greeted him; and Miles
dropped the wood and wondered what he had done
wrong. "Pray you, sir, John Alden told me I
might take that fowling piece," he offered his
excuses.</p>

<p>"Am I always so severe that you look for naught
but chiding from me, Miles?" Master Hopkins
said sternly, yet with something half wistful in his
tone. "I would but say to you that Captain
Standish has long urged me to let you be one of
his household, and I have as long withstood him.
For all he is a brave gentleman, he is not of the
faith in which your father lived. But he has urged
me strongly this day, and you, too, Miles, you bore
yourself fairly this morning; you have tried to bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
yourself well these last weeks, I can see. 'Tis possible
that you will not suffer Miles Standish to spoil
you with lax discipline, and in matters of faith you
cannot go very far astray in this colony. So I think
it safe now to leave this matter to your own decision.
You may stay in my house, or go unto the Captain."</p>

<p>Miles breathed quickly and cracked a bit of bark
between his fingers. "Am I to decide now, sir?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, now. There is a kinsman of Mistress
Hopkins's come on the <i>Fortune</i> who will take your
place in my household if you go. But you need
not go for that. As long as I have a house, there
is a place for you therein, if you elect to stay."</p>

<p>It seemed an easy thing to say, he knew what he
desired, yet when Master Hopkins stood looking
gravely down at him and waiting for his answer,
Miles found it hard to give. "I&mdash;I&mdash; You've
been good to me, after all, sir," he faltered. "I'm
sorry I've vexed you so many times. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In short, you wish to go to the Captain,"
Master Hopkins interrupted. "Very well, Miles
Rigdale. Be it as you wish."</p>

<p>Then he walked away, and Miles, gathering up
his armful of wood for the last time, wondered that,
now he had his desire, he felt a half sorrow that it
was granted him.</p>

<p>But when he entered the house, different thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
came to him. All was stir and bustle within, for
Mistress Hopkins was cooking supper for the men
with sea-appetites, who were to eat there that night,
and suddenly Miles felt it quite a part of the day's
upheaval that he should leave his old home. All
afire with the pleasure of it, he went into the chamber,
where he tied up his few clothes in his cloak.</p>

<p>Ned Lister, who was stretched upon his bed,
pulled himself up on his elbow to watch him. "So
you're going to live with the Captain, Miley," he
repeated the boy's news. "Well, it's far better that
you should; there'll be no one in his house to lead
you into mischief." Ned's face grew serious and he
was silent a moment, then broke out, "On my soul,
I have liked you, lad, and I shall miss you."</p>

<p>"I shall see you every day," Miles answered, setting
himself down on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>"Hm!" Lister retorted. "Your Captain doesn't
like me, Miles. Though he did trouble himself to
see how I was faring, when he came to speak with
Hopkins this afternoon; after all, he's a good fellow,
though I've no liking for the punishments he
gives. But that'll change now. There's a pack of
jolly good fellows come in the <i>Fortune</i>, they say, will
keep him busy. Plague of this ankle! I might 'a'
gone out and made friends with them, and I'm sick
to have speech again with an ungodly rascal like
myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Just there Constance pushed open the door and
came in to bring Ned his supper, so Miles gathered
up his bundle to go forth. But Constance had to
kiss him good-bye, right before Ned, and tell him
to come back often. "I will," Miles promised
soberly. "You've been good to me, Constance,
and&mdash;and if 'twill help you, I'll come tend Damaris&mdash;once
in a while."</p>

<p>"No, you shan't, dear, ever again," Constance
said, laughing, and pushed him out of the room.</p>

<p>He took the Bible that had been his father's
from the chimneypiece, and, while Mistress Hopkins
was busy talking to her kinsman, a grave young
man who found no opportunity to answer her,
thought to slip quietly out of the house. But
Elizabeth Hopkins spied him. "Where are your
manners, child, that you cannot say 'God be wi'
you'?" she assailed him. "After what I've borne
from your carelessness, Miles, and I'm sure your
clothes never will be tidily mended now, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there Miles got the door open and scampered
away. Trug came leaping at his heels, and, fast as
if Mistress Hopkins were likely to pursue him, he
ran till he reached the Captain's very dooryard, and
was quite breathless when he opened the door.</p>

<p>Inside, the candles were lit, the meat was on the
table, and the Captain and Alden and four of the
newcomers were making their supper and talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
heartily the while. At the noise of the opening
door they all faced about, and Miles felt shy and
abashed. "If it like you, Captain Standish," he
stammered, "Master Hopkins said I could come,
so I came."</p>

<p>"And you are right welcome, Miles," Standish
said quickly. "We looked for you to-night. Put
down your bundle and come to the table. Let
your dog come in, too."</p>

<p>Miles slipped into a cranny on the form between
Alden and a black-haired young man named De la
Noye. It was a roast duck they had for supper,
and the men fed Trug right at table, and they talked
a deal, of Indians and of hunting and of planting,
and then, as the Captain and Alden guided the conversation,
of the Parliament and of the Spanish influence
and the war in the Palatinate, till, spite of
the excitement of the evening, Miles's head nodded,
and at heart he was glad when at length, long after
the sober bedtime hour of Plymouth, the men
cleared the table hastily and went to their rest.</p>

<p>The newcomers were bidden lie that night in the
bedroom, since two of them still were weak with seasickness,
but Alden and the Captain were to sleep
in the living room, so Miles silently elected to stay
with them, and he was glad when the chamber door
closed behind the strangers.</p>

<p>"So you've a mind to share the floor with us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Miles?" the Captain asked, as he threw off his
doublet.</p>

<p>"'Tis like a soldier to sleep where 'tis hard,"
Miles confessed shyly.</p>

<p>Standish smiled a little. "We'll surely make a
fighting man of you, Miles, or you'll make one of
yourself. 'Twas a pretty race you ran alone this
morning, your friend Lister told me."</p>

<p>"Lister made a stout march of it, too," put in
Alden, who had already rolled himself in his blanket
and settled down on the floor.</p>

<p>"There's more mettle in that rapscallion than
I judged," Standish answered thoughtfully, and
then: "Lie you down, Miles. Eh? No blanket?
Here, take my cloak; 'tis ample enough for you."</p>

<p>Indeed, it was, and very brave and martial, too.
Miles curled himself up in it, and liked the manly
hardness of the floor beneath his shoulders. He
closed his eyes and half dozed, then, hearing Alden's
voice, roused up a little.</p>

<p>"Captain," the young man was speaking softly,
"there's not an ounce of extra provisions in the
<i>Fortune</i>."</p>

<p>From the neighboring corner where Standish had
stretched himself came a non-committal "Um."</p>

<p>"And half these young fellows are equipped with
nothing but the clothes they stand in; they gambled
away their very cloaks, when the ship touched at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Plymouth in Devonshire." There was silence in
the living room for a time, before Alden resumed,
"We had enough to do in the colony before, sir;
now what shall we do with these?"</p>

<p>"Why, some we'll set to ploughing and some we'll
set to fight the Indians," said Standish. "And
those that will neither plough nor fight, we'll pack
home to England. We've no use for idlers here."</p>

<p>Then again there was silence in the living room,
and the embers in the fireplace gleamed red, and
once, leaping into flame, set black shadows fluttering
on the wall. "We've no use for idlers," Miles
repeated to himself. "But I'll work as mother
would wish me to, now I am in the Captain's
house."</p>

<p>He drew the Captain's cloak closer about him,
and thought to amuse himself with pretending he
was a true soldier, like the Captain, sleeping in his
military cloak out under the stars, but the reality
pleased him better than the fancy. He lay with his
eyes wide open, smiling at the embers. "The Captain's
house," he repeated. "And I shall stay here
always."</p>
